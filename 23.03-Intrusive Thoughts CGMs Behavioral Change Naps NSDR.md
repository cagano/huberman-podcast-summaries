### Defining Intrusive Thoughts [0:01:53]
- Intrusive thoughts are perceptions generated internally, distinct from sensations, perceptions, emotions, or behaviors. 
- They often run automatically in the background as mental chatter and can be structured or unstructured.
-  Distinguishing between intrusive thoughts that are merely repetitive and those that are disturbing is crucial for determining the appropriate approach. 

### Strategies for Repetitive Intrusive Thoughts [0:09:19]

### Strategies for Disturbing Intrusive Thoughts [0:14:42]
- **Journaling:** Writing down detailed descriptions of the disturbing thoughts and the emotions associated with them can reduce their frequency and intensity.
