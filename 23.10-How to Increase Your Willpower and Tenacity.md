## How to Increase Your Willpower and Tenacity

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tenacity and willpower are not the same as habit execution.** They require effort and energy to engage in or resist specific behaviors, thoughts, or actions.
2. **The anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) is a crucial brain "hub" for tenacity and willpower.** It receives input from diverse brain areas, including reward systems, autonomic nervous system, and executive function centers.
3. **Willpower can be a limited resource, possibly related to glucose availability, but it can also be unlimited depending on beliefs.**  
4. **The aMCC can be strengthened through novel physical and cognitive challenges.**  Engage in activities you don't want to do or resist behaviors you're tempted to engage in.
5. **Rewarding yourself occasionally for overcoming challenging situations can further reinforce tenacity and willpower.**

## Introduction

This episode of the Huberman Lab podcast delves into the science of tenacity and willpower, exploring their psychological and neurological underpinnings. Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford University, discusses key research findings and provides actionable strategies to enhance these valuable qualities in everyday life.

### Tenacity & Willpower vs. Habit Execution; Apathy, Depression & Motivation (0:03:49)

- **Tenacity and willpower are distinct from habit execution, which are automatic behaviors we perform without much effort.**
- **Willpower requires effort to intervene in our default neural processes.** 
- **Apathy and depression lie at one end of a continuum, while tenacity and willpower reside on the other end.**
- **Motivation serves as the "engine" that allows us to move up and down this continuum.**

### Ego Depletion & Willpower as a Limited Resource; Controversy (0:10:40)

- **Ego depletion theory suggests willpower is a finite resource that becomes depleted with each decision or effort.**
- **Research on ego depletion has been contentious, with some studies supporting and others contradicting its conclusions.**
- **Understanding the concept of ego depletion is crucial for comprehending the opposing viewpoint on willpower.**

### Willpower as a Limited Resource (Theory): Roy Baumeister's Data (0:28:58)

- **Baumeister's early studies suggested willpower is a limited resource, using the "radish vs. cookies" experiment.**
- **Subjects who resisted eating cookies (a harder task) performed worse on a subsequent challenging puzzle.**
- **This led to the belief that willpower is depleted by successive efforts.**

### Willpower & Glucose, Brain Energetics (0:35:36)

- **Baumeister's later research proposed that glucose availability in the brain might be the limiting factor for willpower.**
- **Studies showed that consuming a glucose drink between challenging tasks improved performance on subsequent tasks.**
- **This led to the idea that glucose could be used to "fuel" willpower.**

### Beliefs about Willpower & Glucose; Multiple Challenges (0:42:44)

- **Dr. Carol Dweck's research found that belief about willpower and glucose's role in it influenced performance.**
- **Subjects who believed willpower was a limited resource, and glucose was the limiting factor, showed improved performance with glucose intake.**
- **Those who didn't hold this belief showed similar performance regardless of glucose consumption, suggesting belief can override physiological limitations.**

### Willpower Brain ‘Hub’; Anorexia Nervosa, Super-Agers (0:54:01)

- **Numerous studies point to the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) as the central brain area for generating tenacity and willpower.**
- **The aMCC receives input from diverse brain areas, including the autonomic nervous system, reward systems, and executive function centers.**
- **Individuals with anorexia nervosa show heightened aMCC activity when resisting food.**
- **Superagers, individuals who maintain youthful cognitive function in older age, have larger aMCCs.**

### Anterior Midcingulate Cortex & Brain/Body Communication (1:07:15)

- **The aMCC is directly connected to areas of the brain and body that regulate autonomic function, interoception, and exteroception.**
- **It communicates with reward pathways (dopamine system), premotor centers, and endocrine system.**
- **The aMCC plays a key role in "allostasis," the allocation of resources to different brain and body areas based on motivational goals and challenges.**

### Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex (aMCC), Difficult Tasks & Neuroplasticity (1:25:19)

- **The aMCC is activated by both physical movement and cognitive effort, especially when we engage in challenging tasks.**
- **The aMCC exhibits neuroplasticity, meaning it can be strengthened through repeated activation.**
- **Building up the aMCC through novel challenges enhances tenacity and willpower in other domains of life.**

### Tool: Novel Physical Exercise & Brain; Cognitive Exercise (1:29:30)

- **Moderate to high-intensity cardiovascular training (3 hours per week) has been shown to maintain or increase the volume of the aMCC and its white matter connections.**
- **This suggests engaging in novel physical exercise that requires effort and resistance can strengthen the aMCC.**
- **Cognitive challenges, such as learning a new language or musical instrument, also activate the aMCC and can improve tenacity and willpower.**

### Tool: “Micro-sucks”, Increase Tenacity/Willpower (1:43:43)

- **Micro-sucks are small, challenging tasks that you don't want to do, but are safe and require effort.**
- **Examples include extra sets of exercise, jumping jacks after a run, or delaying your first meal.**
- **Engaging in these micro-sucks regularly can stimulate the aMCC and increase tenacity and willpower.**

### Impossible Tasks, Super-Agers & Learning, Will to Live (1:50:58)

- **Pursuing "impossible tasks" or challenging endeavors without a clear finish line can continuously build tenacity and willpower.**
- **Superagers often engage in challenging activities, learn new skills, and explore new environments, contributing to their exceptional cognitive function and longevity.**
- **The aMCC's role in allocating resources and promoting tenacity may be linked to the "will to live."**

### Tool: Rewards & Improving Tenacity/Willpower (1:57:23)

- **Rewarding yourself occasionally for successfully overcoming challenges can reinforce tenacity and willpower.**
- **Choose healthy and safe rewards that are personally meaningful.**
- **This strategy is based on the concept of stress relief as a natural resilience mechanism.**

## Practical Advice and Strategies

### Enhance Autonomic Function (0:19:14)

- **Prioritize getting sufficient quality sleep on a regular basis.**
- **Manage stress levels through effective coping strategies.**
- **Minimize distractions to avoid depletion of willpower.**

### Engage in Novel Physical Exercise (1:29:30)

- **Engage in moderate to high-intensity cardiovascular training for at least 150 minutes per week.**
- **Add novel physical challenges that you don't want to do but are safe.**
- **Focus on building up resistance to your default tendencies.**

### Embrace Cognitive Challenges (1:43:43)

- **Learn new skills, languages, or subjects.**
- **Seek out cognitive challenges that push your limits.**
- **Make deliberate efforts to stay intellectually engaged.**

### Incorporate "Micro-sucks" (1:43:43)

- **Introduce small, challenging tasks into your routine.**
- **These could be extra sets of exercise, resistance to distractions, or pushing your boundaries in other areas.**

### Embrace "Impossible Tasks" (1:50:58)

- **Engage in activities that lack a clear finish line.**
- **This continuous pursuit of challenges can strengthen tenacity and willpower.**

### Reward Yourself Occasionally (1:57:23)

- **Provide yourself with healthy and safe rewards for successfully overcoming challenges.**
- **Use rewards to reinforce positive behaviors associated with tenacity and willpower.**
