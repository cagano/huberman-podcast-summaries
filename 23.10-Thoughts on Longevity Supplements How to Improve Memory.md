## Thoughts on Longevity Supplements: How to Improve Memory 

## Key Takeaways
1. **Resveratrol for Longevity:** While resveratrol may have some health benefits, there's little evidence to support its ability to extend lifespan. 
2. **NAD Boosting Supplements:** While NR and NMN may increase NAD levels, their effect on lifespan is unclear. The host takes them for energy benefits but not longevity.
3. **NAD Infusions:** Although uncomfortable, NAD infusions have shown anecdotal improvements in vigor and recovery from illness, but further research is needed.
4. **Metformin and Berberine:** The host doesn't take either for longevity due to insufficient data and personal side effects.
5. **Rapamycin:** While actively researched for lifespan extension, the host doesn't take it due to potential side effects and insufficient evidence. 
6. **Prioritizing Lifestyle:** Exercise, sleep, nutrition, social connection, stress management, and sunlight are crucial for health and longevity, far more impactful than supplements.
7. **Consult a Physician:** Always consult a board-certified physician before adding or removing supplements or prescription drugs.

## Introduction

This episode is an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session where Professor Andrew Huberman addresses listener questions about longevity supplements and discusses his personal experiences with various supplements and NAD infusions.  He emphasizes the importance of lifestyle factors in promoting health and longevity over relying solely on supplements.

### Resveratrol and Longevity Supplements [0:01:46]

- **Resveratrol's Limited Role:** Research has debunked the idea that resveratrol significantly extends lifespan, despite its potential cellular benefits. 
- **Grape Seed Extract:** The host takes 400-800mg of grape seed extract daily for its benefits on vascular function and blood flow, not for lifespan extension.

### NAD-Related Pathways and Longevity [0:02:46]

- **NAD and Lifespan:** While NAD is crucial for cellular energy, there's limited evidence suggesting that increasing NAD levels directly translates to increased lifespan.
- **NR and NMN Supplements:** The host takes both NR (500mg) and NMN (1-2g) daily for sustained mental and physical energy, not lifespan extension.
- **NAD Infusions:** The host has tried NAD infusions twice and found them effective for boosting energy and recovery, but uncomfortable. They acknowledge the lack of clinical trial data for this application.
- **Oral NAD:** There are oral NAD products available, but research on their efficacy and effectiveness is lacking.

### Metformin and Berberine [0:09:42]

- **Metformin and Berberine's Mechanisms:** Both target the mTOR pathway, a key regulator of cell growth, which is thought to be involved in aging.
- **Host's Experience:** The host does not take berberine due to debilitating headaches and does not take metformin due to insufficient data on lifespan extension.

### Rapamycin and Longevity Research [0:11:13]

- **Rapamycin and mTOR:** This drug targets mTOR and is actively being researched for its potential to extend lifespan. 
- **Host's Perspective:** Despite the potential benefits, the host does not take rapamycin due to potential side effects and insufficient evidence for lifespan extension.

## Practical Advice and Strategies

### Sleep and Exercise for Longevity [0:13:57]

- **Prioritize Sleep:** Getting sufficient quality sleep is essential for overall health and lifespan. 
- **Exercise is Key:** Consistent exercise, including both cardio and strength training, has a much larger impact on health and longevity than supplements.

### Other Lifestyle Factors for Longevity [0:15:08]

- **Nutrition:** Emphasize a healthy, balanced diet.
- **Social Connection:** Foster meaningful relationships and avoid toxic social connections.
- **Stress Management:** Implement strategies to manage stress effectively.
- **Sunlight:** Get sufficient morning sunlight to regulate your circadian rhythm.

## Tools and Resources Mentioned

- **NR Supplement:** The host takes 500mg of NR daily.
- **NMN Supplement:** The host takes 1-2g of NMN daily.
- **NAD Infusions:** The host has tried NAD infusions and found them effective, but uncomfortable.
- **Dr. Peter Attia:**  A physician who has extensively researched metformin, rapamycin, and longevity.
