## How to Build Endurance in Your Brain and Body

## Key Takeaways
1. **There are four distinct types of endurance:** muscular endurance, long duration endurance, anaerobic high intensity interval training (HIIT), and aerobic HIIT.
2. **Endurance training benefits brain health:** by increasing oxygen utilization, improving blood flow, and promoting microvasculature development, leading to better cognitive function, focus, and memory.
3. **The "90% mental" myth is false:**  Everything is physical, and everything is neurons. Your thinking is the result of chemicals and electrical signals in your brain.
4. **There's a right way to hydrate:** Use the "Galpin Equation" (body weight in pounds / 30 = ounces of fluid per 15 minutes of exercise) to determine your fluid needs.
5. **Warm up your intercostals:** Prior to endurance work, engage in deep breathing exercises to expand your rib cage and improve oxygen delivery.
6. **Embrace the "kick":** Focusing on a visual target can unlock a powerful extra gear, enabling you to push beyond perceived limits.
7. **Concurrent training is possible:** Integrate strength, hypertrophy, and flexibility training with endurance workouts to optimize overall fitness, but allow sufficient rest between sessions.


## Introduction

This episode delves into the science and protocols for building endurance, revealing the interconnectedness of brain and body function.  Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford, discusses the four types of endurance, how they work, and how to train them effectively.

### Energy and Fuel Utilization (0:14:38)

- **ATP:** Adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of the body, is required for all physical and mental effort.
- **Multiple fuel sources:** The body can convert carbohydrates (glucose and glycogen), fats (lipids), and creatine into ATP.
- **Oxygen is essential:** Most energy production processes require oxygen, emphasizing the importance of proper breathing.
- **The central governor:** A network of neurons in the brainstem determines our ability to persist, making willpower a neural phenomenon.

###  The Limiting Factors of Endurance (0:20:46)

- **Nerves:** Require glucose, sodium, potassium, and magnesium to function optimally.
- **Muscle:** Utilizes phosphocreatine and glycogen for energy, and is influenced by pH and temperature.
- **Blood:** Delivers glucose, oxygen, and fatty acids as fuel sources.
- **Heart:** Pumps blood and oxygen to working tissues.
- **Lungs:** Intake and distribute oxygen to the body.

### Muscular Endurance (0:38:53)

- **Definition:** The ability of muscles to perform work over time, limited by muscle fatigue.
- **Benefits:** Improves posture, golf swing, tennis swing, dance, and repeated activities requiring effort.
- **Training protocol:** 3-5 sets of 12-100 repetitions (ideally 12-25) with 30-180 seconds of rest.
- **Example exercises:** Push-ups, planks, wall sits, kettlebell swings, isometric holds.
- **Key feature:** Primarily concentric movement with minimal eccentric loading.
- **Science:** Builds mitochondrial respiration and enhances neural control of muscle contraction. 

### Long Duration Endurance (0:51:31)

- **Definition:**  Effort extending from 12 minutes to several hours, relying on efficient movement.
- **Benefits:** Improves capillary density in muscles and brain, enhances mitochondrial function, and increases efficiency of movement.
- **Training protocol:** One set of 12 minutes or longer at less than 100% of VO2 max.
- **Example exercises:** Long runs, swims, bike rides, hikes.
- **Science:**  Increases capillary beds, improving oxygen delivery and utilization, and leading to a greater ability to sustain effort. 

### Anaerobic HIIT (1:02:20)

- **Definition:** High-intensity interval training that pushes the body beyond its maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max).
- **Benefits:** Improves oxygen utilization, strengthens nerve-muscle connections, and enhances mitochondrial respiration.
- **Training protocol:** 3-12 sets with a work-to-rest ratio of 3:1 to 1:5 (e.g., 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off; 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off).
- **Example exercises:** Sprints, burpees, kettlebell swings, assault bike sprints.
- **Science:**  Drives adaptations in both the mitochondrial and neural systems, leading to increased power and ability to perform short bursts of intense effort.

### Aerobic HIIT (1:10:59)

- **Definition:** High-intensity interval training with a focus on maximizing oxygen utilization.
- **Benefits:** Improves heart and lung capacity, enhances blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles and brain.
- **Training protocol:** 3-12 sets with a work-to-rest ratio of 1:1 (e.g., run a mile, rest for an equivalent time).
- **Example exercises:** Mile repeats, interval swimming, stair climber intervals.
- **Science:** Triggers adaptations in all major energy systems, including the nervous system, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs, leading to increased endurance and performance across various activities.

### Heart and Lung Adaptations (1:15:20)

- **Stroke volume:** Intense exercise, particularly anaerobic and aerobic HIIT, increases blood return to the heart, strengthening the cardiac muscle and increasing stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped per beat).
- **Benefits:** Improved oxygen delivery to muscles and brain, enhanced performance, and reduced resting heart rate.
- **Brain benefits:** Increased blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, promoting microvasculature development and supporting cognitive function.

### Breathing Techniques (1:25:45)

- **Nasal breathing:** Generally more efficient and beneficial than mouth breathing, especially for long duration efforts.
- **Mouth breathing:** Useful for exhaling forcefully and for high intensity work.
- **Gear system:**  A framework for transitioning between nasal and mouth breathing based on effort level.
- **Intercostal muscle warmup:**  Focus on expanding the rib cage and raising the ribs during deep breaths, improving oxygen delivery.
- **Diaphragmatic breathing:**  Contracting the diaphragm to expand the stomach during inhalation, a key element in warming up the breathing muscles.
- **Physiological sighs:** Double inhalations followed by a full exhalation to alleviate "side stitches" during exercise.

###  Additional Tools and Strategies (1:34:45)

- **Accelerating through "the wall":**  Increasing speed during prolonged effort can unlock alternative fuel sources.
- **Exogenous ketones:**  Supplementing with ketones alongside carbohydrates can provide additional energy.
- **Parasympathetic downregulation:**  Taking 5-20 minutes after training to engage in slow, nasal breathing or relaxation techniques can accelerate recovery.
- **Visual pacing:**  Using landmarks and visual targets during endurance work can increase effort and improve pacing strategies.

### Programming and Concurrent Training (1:56:00)

- **Concurrent training:**  Combining endurance training with strength, hypertrophy, and flexibility workouts.
- **Rest and recovery:**  Allowing at least 4-6 hours and ideally 24 hours between workouts to promote adaptation and recovery.
- **Supplements:**  Caffeine can enhance endurance performance, while magnesium malate can reduce muscle soreness.
