## How Placebo Effects Work to Change Our Biology and Psychology

## Key Takeaways
1. Placebo, nocebo, and belief effects all rely on the brain's ability to change expectations and influence physiology.
2. The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in shaping these effects by activating or suppressing other brain circuits.
3. Placebo effects can be highly specific, impacting specific hormones, neurotransmitters, and bodily functions.
4. The strength of placebo effects can be influenced by factors like context, the invasiveness of the treatment, and the perceived quality of the treatment.
5. Placebo effects have limitations; they cannot cure diseases like cancer but can reduce symptoms associated with treatments.
6. Individual variation in genetics can contribute to the strength of placebo effects.

## Introduction

This episode delves into the fascinating world of placebo effects, exploring how our expectations and beliefs can profoundly alter our biology and psychology.  Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford, and guest Dr. Alia Crum, a professor of psychology at Stanford, discuss the science behind these effects, providing actionable advice and practical strategies to harness their power for improved health and performance.

### Placebo, Nocebo, and Belief Effects [0:00:00]

- Placebo effects occur when an inert substance or treatment produces a positive effect, improving symptoms or performance.
- Nocebo effects are the opposite; they occur when an inert substance or treatment worsens symptoms or performance.
- Belief effects are a more specific term for when learned knowledge changes expectations, leading to a specific outcome.
- All three effects rely on the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for expectation and prediction, to influence various physiological functions.

### Dopamine, Placebo, and Parkinson’s Disease [0:14:03]

- Studies on Parkinson’s disease patients show that placebos can increase dopamine release in the brain, even though they have no direct effect on dopamine levels.
- While placebos can improve Parkinson’s symptoms, the effect is generally less robust than actual dopamine-enhancing drugs.
- This highlights the role of expectation in drug efficacy; our beliefs about a treatment can influence its effectiveness.

### Hormone Release and the Placebo Effect [0:21:36]

- Studies demonstrate that pairing an injection with a drug that influences hormone levels (e.g., sumatriptan increasing growth hormone) can lead to a conditioned response.
- Subsequent injections of saline, which has no direct effect, can still cause similar hormonal changes due to the association between the injection and the expected hormonal outcome.
- This illustrates the brain's ability to form strong associations between stimuli and physiological responses.

### Conditioning Effects and Insulin [0:28:52]

- Classical conditioning, as seen in Pavlov’s dogs, demonstrates how stimuli unrelated to a response (e.g., a bell) can evoke that response (e.g., salivation) through repeated pairings.
- This applies to insulin release; smells associated with food can trigger insulin production, and even non-food stimuli can elicit the same response through conditioning.

### Context and Expectations [0:34:17]

- Placebo effects are influenced by factors like the perceived quality of a treatment (brand name vs. generic), the invasiveness of the intervention (pill vs. injection vs. machine), and the color of a pill (associations with sleep, stimulation, or anti-depression).
- These factors contribute to the expectation of an outcome, further influencing the placebo effect.

### Cancer, Mind-Body Practices, and Placebo Effects [0:40:51]

- While placebo effects can reduce the discomfort of cancer treatments, they cannot directly reduce tumor size or eliminate tumors.
- This emphasizes the limitations of placebo effects, highlighting the distinction between genuine treatment effects (e.g., chemotherapy) and belief-driven effects.
- Mind-body practices like meditation, sleep, and social support can improve cancer outcomes, but these are real effects on inflammation and stress, not placebo effects.

### Asthma, Specificity, and Placebo Effects [0:44:54]

- Studies on asthma patients show that placebos can reduce discomfort associated with breathing difficulties but do not restore normal breathing patterns.
- This underscores the specificity of placebo effects, demonstrating that they can target certain aspects of a condition without completely eliminating it.

### Nicotine and Dose-Dependent Placebo Effects [0:49:03]

- A study on nicotine vaping demonstrates a dose-dependent placebo effect; subjects told they received a higher concentration of nicotine performed better on a cognitive task, even though everyone received the same dose.
- This suggests that the expectation of a stronger effect can lead to a stronger effect, even with the same dose of the active substance.

### Placebo Effects vs. Belief Effects [0:55:31]

- The distinction between placebo and belief effects is subtle, but belief effects often involve a more specific and nuanced understanding of the expected outcome.
- Dr. Crum’s research on belief effects highlights their powerful influence on physiological responses, such as the ghrelin response to milkshakes.

### Exercise and Belief Effects [1:01:02]

- Dr. Crum’s study on hotel service workers demonstrates that simply believing one’s daily activities are exercise can lead to positive health outcomes, including reductions in blood pressure and body weight.
- This highlights the potential for belief effects to impact even deeply ingrained physiological responses related to physical activity.

### Placebo Effect, Brain, and Stress Response [1:04:08]

- The prefrontal cortex sends signals to the hypothalamus, a brain region involved in the stress response, influencing physiological parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.
- Research on rats identifies specific neural pathways connecting the prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus, demonstrating the biological mechanisms underlying psychosomatic effects.

### Individual Variation, Genetics, and the Placebo Effect [1:11:18]

- The strength of placebo effects can vary significantly across individuals, with some individuals showing a more robust response than others.
- Genetic factors, such as the COMT gene involved in dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine regulation, can influence susceptibility to placebo effects.

###  Conclusion

The episode concludes with a comprehensive understanding of the biological underpinnings and real-world applications of placebo, nocebo, and belief effects. It highlights the power of our beliefs and expectations to shape our physiology, offering actionable advice for harnessing these effects for improved health and well-being.
