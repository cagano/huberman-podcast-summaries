# Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness, Expand Your Mind

## Key Takeaways
1. **Meditation's Primary Value:** The core benefit of meditation isn't just stress reduction or focus enhancement, but viewing consciousness itself. This allows for profound shifts in self-awareness and engagement with the world. 
2. **The Illusion of Self:** The sense of "I" as a separate subject experiencing the world is an illusion. Meditation helps to unravel this duality between subject and object, revealing that there is just experience.
3. **The Role of Attention:** Our attention constantly shifts, and we are frequently unaware of this, including the moments we lose our sense of self. This is similar to how our visual system suppresses visual information during eye movements (saccades). 
4. **Mindfulness and Time Perception:** Mindfulness practices like Vipassana meditation can increase the "frame rate" of our conscious experience, allowing us to notice finer details and shifts in sensory experience, including pain. 
5. **The Nature of Thought:** We are constantly thinking, and often unaware of the ongoing internal dialogue. Meditation helps us to become more mindful of these thoughts, allowing us to observe them without getting lost in them.

## Introduction
In this episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Sam Harris, a renowned neuroscientist, philosopher, and author, about the power of meditation to unlock deeper understanding of consciousness and the self. They delve into the concept of the illusory self, the role of attention in shaping our experience, the nature of thought, and the transformative potential of both meditation and psychedelics. The episode also touches upon the topic of free will, the importance of deep work, and Harris's recent decision to leave Twitter.

### The Illusory Self and Meditation (0:08:54)
- **Dualism of Self:** Most people experience a sense of separation between their "self" and their experience, feeling like a passenger inside their body.
- **Meditation's Goal:** By looking for this "I", meditation reveals its illusory nature. The true value of meditation lies in this deeper discovery, rather than just its known benefits like stress reduction. 

### The Sense of Self in the Brain and Body (0:18:07)
- **Brain as Locus of Self:** The brain is likely the central location for our sense of self, though the whole nervous system contributes. 
- **Shifting Sense of Self:** We can experience shifts in our sense of self during intense emotional states like fear or ecstasy, feeling more embodied.
- **Procedural Memory:**  Some aspects of our identity are only invoked when we are physically engaged with the world, highlighting the importance of embodied experience. 

### Consciousness and Its Contents (0:25:28)
- **Consciousness vs. Contents:**  Consciousness is the awareness itself, while its contents are the specific information we perceive. Meditation can help us to recognize the nature of consciousness itself, regardless of its changing contents. 
- **Psychedelics and Meditation:** Psychedelics change the contents of consciousness, while meditation seeks to understand the underlying nature of consciousness. These practices are not necessarily opposing, but can be seen as complementary.

### Interrupting the Sense of Self and Attentional Focus (0:28:25)
- **Visual Saccades:** Our visual system constantly suppresses visual information during eye movements, demonstrating the brain's ability to interrupt conscious experience without our awareness.
- **Losing Ourselves in Experience:**  Flow states, such as those found in athletic activities or peak experiences, often involve a brief period of unity with the experience, where the sense of self dissolves.
- **Internal Dialogue:** Our internal dialogue often acts like a constant commentary on our experiences, interrupting the direct experience of the present moment.

### The Observer and the Actor (0:33:30)
- **Default Mode Network:** This brain network, active when the brain is at rest, is associated with self-referential thought, mind-wandering, and self-talk. 
- **Meditation and Psychedelics:** Both meditation and psychedelics have been shown to suppress activity in the default mode network, which may contribute to their effects on the sense of self. 
- **Optic Blind Spot:** Similar to the visual blind spot, the sense of self can be overlooked because it is so close to us, making it difficult to notice.

### Meditation and Paths to Understanding Consciousness (0:41:57)
- **Non-Dualistic Experience:** Meditation aims to unravel the duality between subject and object in consciousness, recognizing that there is just experience.
- **Visual Illusions and Insight:**  Visual illusions like bi-stable percepts (e.g., vase-face diagrams) offer a model for how we can see something that was previously hidden, suggesting that our perception is flexible and can be altered by shifting our attention. 

### Distraction and Mindfulness (1:19:46)
- **Internal Chatter:** Most people are constantly engaged in internal dialogue, which can be a significant source of distraction. 
- **Mindfulness:**  Mindfulness is a practice of paying attention to the contents of consciousness without getting lost in thought, allowing us to observe thoughts and feelings as they arise. 
- **Distractibility:** Even the seemingly simple task of paying attention to an object for 30 seconds without getting lost in thought is extremely challenging for most people. 

### Time Perception and Mindfulness (1:26:27)
- **Multiple Streams of Time Perception:** We may experience time differently for objects at different distances. 
- **Mindfulness and Frame Rate:** Mindfulness practices can increase the frame rate of our conscious experience, allowing us to perceive more subtle changes and details.
- **Vipassana Meditation:** This practice involves paying detailed attention to sensory experience, breaking down sensations into their basic components. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of experience and a reduction in suffering.

### Authoring Thoughts (1:43:14)
- **Storytelling and Ideas:** Our brains are constantly generating thoughts, and we often create stories about why those thoughts arise. However, we have limited control over which thoughts emerge.
- **Free Will:**  The notion of free will is an illusion because we do not truly control our thoughts. 

### Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self (1:52:11)
- **The Gap between Actor and Observer:** The sense of a separate actor and observer within us is an illusion, and meditation reveals this. 
- **Witnessing the Illusion:** We can witness this illusion by focusing on the act of paying attention itself, recognizing that there is no separate "self" doing the observing. 

### Meditation & Concentration Practice (2:06:44)
- **Meditation as Non-Distraction:** Meditation is not about doing more, but rather about ceasing to do something. It is a practice of being present with consciousness and its contents without getting distracted by thought. 
- **Concentration Practice:** This type of meditation involves focusing on a single object like the breath or a mantra, developing a skill of focused attention. It can be a valuable tool for cultivating mindfulness.
- **Mindfulness Meditation:** Mindfulness involves paying attention to whatever arises in consciousness without judgment, including sights, sounds, sensations, and thoughts.
- **"Skylike Mind":**  The goal of mindfulness is to cultivate a mind that is open and receptive to all experiences, without clinging to or resisting anything.

### Mindfulness, "Skylike Mind" & Thoughts (2:11:58)
- **The Fleeting Nature of Perception:**  All perception is a process, not a noun. Meditation can help us to see the fleeting nature of perception and move beyond the limitations of language in describing the brain's workings. 

### States of Self and Context (2:15:11)
- **Shifting States of Self:**  We inhabit different modes of being depending on the context.  
- **Context-Dependent Rule Sets:**  The prefrontal cortex plays a role in establishing context-dependent rule sets that shape our thoughts and behaviors.

### Distraction and Identification of Thoughts (2:32:39)
- **Distraction:**  Distraction is a common barrier to mindfulness. It can be both internally generated (thoughts) and externally generated (stimuli like social media). 
- **Shedding the Wetsuit:**  Distraction can be seen as a kind of "wetsuit" that limits our experience. Meditation helps us to shed this wetsuit and access a more expansive and sensitive awareness.

### Eyes-Open Meditations (2:42:58)
- **Visual Cues and Social Interactions:**  Visual cues play a significant role in anchoring our sense of self, especially in social interactions. 
- **Losing the Sense of Self in Social Encounters:** When we lose our sense of self in a social setting, we can become more present and less self-conscious, allowing us to truly engage with the other person. 
- **The "I-Thou" Relationship:** This philosophical concept describes a way of relating to another person without judgment or self-consciousness. 

### Psychedelics (3:05:58)
- **Psychedelics as Tools for Change:** Psychedelics can alter the contents of consciousness, leading to profound experiences that can reveal new possibilities and insights. 
- **MDMA:** While often called an entactogen, MDMA is not a psychedelic. It can enhance empathy and pro-social behavior, but doesn't necessarily change perception in the same way as classic psychedelics.
- **Therapeutic Potential:** Psychedelics have shown promise in treating conditions like depression and PTSD, but they should be used safely and responsibly. 

### Psilocybin and Ego-Dissolution (3:29:48)
- **Ego Dissolution:** Psilocybin, particularly at high doses, can lead to experiences of ego-dissolution, where the sense of self dissolves. 
- **Psilocybin and Meditation:** Psilocybin can facilitate experiences similar to those cultivated through meditation, but meditation allows for more sustained and integrated insights. 

### Process vs. Achievement of Goals (3:40:09)
- **Process Orientation:**  The fulfillment we seek in life is often found in the process of pursuing our goals, rather than the moment of achievement. 
- **Present Moment Fulfillment:**  Meditation and other practices can help us to cultivate a sense of contentment and fulfillment in the present moment, regardless of external circumstances.

### Leaving Twitter (3:54:29)
- **Social Media and Conflict:** Social media platforms like Twitter can be a source of significant conflict and distraction, creating a distorted view of humanity and impinging upon personal well-being. 
- **Deep Work:**  Leaving Twitter allows for a greater capacity for deep work, defined as focused, uninterrupted work on meaningful tasks. 
- **Attentional Disruption:**  Social media platforms like Twitter can be highly addictive and disruptive to our attention, interfering with our ability to engage in deep work and cultivate mindfulness. 

### Meditation & Sense of Self (4:15:39)
- **Meditation as a Practice of Erasing Boundaries:**  Meditation is not a practice to add to life, but rather to erase boundaries between formal practice and the rest of life.
- **Step Functions in Meditation:** Progress in meditation often occurs in step functions, with distinct shifts in understanding and awareness. 
- **Dualistic and Non-Dualistic Mindfulness:**  The initial stage of meditation involves a dualistic understanding of the self as a separate observer. The non-dualistic stage involves recognizing the illusory nature of the self.

### Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys, and Inner Truths (3:21:11)
- **The Role of Psychedelics in the Meditative Journey:**  Psychedelics can play a role in initiating the process of self-exploration, but they are not a substitute for meditation. 
- **Emptiness:**  A central concept in Buddhism, "emptiness" refers to a state of being without a center, allowing for a more expansive and liberating experience.  
- **Equality of Experience:** The recognition of emptiness equalizes all experiences, allowing us to see the inherent value in both pleasant and unpleasant experiences.

###  Meditation and the “Flow” States (2:42:58)
- **Flow States and Meditation:** Flow states are often described as being fully immersed in an activity, where the sense of self dissolves. While these states can be beneficial, they are not a substitute for meditation. 

### Tools and Resources Mentioned
- **Waking Up App:**  A meditation app developed by Sam Harris, offering a range of guided meditations and teachings on mindfulness, self-awareness, and consciousness.
- **Cal Newport's Work on Deep Work:**  An exploration of how to cultivate focus and productivity by minimizing distractions and maximizing deep work sessions.
