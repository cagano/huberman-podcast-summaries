## Breathing for Mental and Physical Health and Performance: A Conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman

## Key Takeaways

1. **Breathing is a fundamental life process with a profound impact on brain state and overall health.**  Beyond its role in oxygen uptake and CO2 removal, breathing patterns influence focus, sleep, stress response, and even cognitive function.
2. **The pre-Botzinger complex and parafacial nucleus are two key brain centers that control different breathing patterns.** The pre-Botzinger complex is primarily responsible for inspiration, while the parafacial nucleus controls active expiration.
3. **Physiological sighs are essential for lung health.** They occur naturally every few minutes to re-inflate collapsed alveoli, preventing lung function decline.
4. **Breathing patterns have a reciprocal relationship with brain state and emotional state.**  Stress can alter breathing, and conversely, deliberately changing breathing patterns can influence mood, fear response, and cognitive performance.
5. **Magnesium threonate may enhance cognitive function and neuro-plasticity.** Research suggests that magnesium threonate can improve cognitive function, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive decline, by increasing magnesium levels in the brain.

### The Mechanics of Breathing (0:10:35)

- **Inspiration:** The diaphragm contracts, pulling downward, and the rib cage rotates upward and outward. This expansion lowers the pressure inside the lungs, drawing in air.
- **Expiration:** At rest, expiration is passive, driven by the elastic recoil of the lungs and rib cage. 
- **Muscles Involved:** The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are skeletal muscles requiring neural input for contraction. Smooth muscles lining the airways can also influence breathing, and their inappropriate contraction can lead to issues like asthma.

### Neural Control of Breathing: The Brainstem's Role (0:14:35)

- **Pre-Botzinger complex:** Located in the brainstem, this small region is critical for generating the rhythmic pattern of inspiration.  
- **Parafacial nucleus:** A second oscillator identified in the brainstem, this region is involved in generating active expiration, particularly during exercise or exertion.
- **Oscillators:** These brain centers act as rhythmic generators, creating cyclical patterns of neural activity that drive the respiratory muscles.

### Nose vs. Mouth Breathing: Are They Functionally Equivalent? (0:16:20)

- While there are differences between nasal and mouth breathing, the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles seems largely agnostic to the route of airflow.
- The pre-Botzinger complex doesn't appear to directly modulate whether air enters through the nose or mouth.

### How Mammalian Breathing is Special (0:26:20)

- The diaphragm, a powerful inspiratory muscle unique to mammals, is a key evolutionary development that allows for efficient oxygen uptake and the development of larger brains.
- The surface area of the alveoli in the lungs is vast, about 70 square meters, allowing for efficient oxygen transfer into the bloodstream.

### Stomach and Chest Movements During Breathing: Diaphragmatic Breathing (0:33:40)

- While the diaphragm is always involved, the relative emphasis on diaphragmatic versus chest breathing varies depending on activity levels and breathwork practices.
- Dr. Feldman is agnostic about the specific benefits of diaphragmatic versus non-diaphragmatic breathing, believing the overall influence of breathing on emotion and cognition is more important.

### Physiological Sighs:  Maintaining Lung Health (0:36:23)

- We sigh every 5 minutes or so to re-inflate collapsed alveoli.  
-  These involuntary sighs help maintain lung function and prevent deterioration. 
-  Bombesin-related peptides, released from the hypothalamus during stress, can increase sigh rate. 

### The Consequences of Not Sighing (0:49:39)

-  Eliminating sighs in rats through the ablation of cells in the pre-Botzinger complex led to significant lung dysfunction and overall health deterioration.
-  This suggests that sighs are essential for maintaining lung health and could be relevant to understanding respiratory decline in diseases like Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple system atrophy.

### The Ascending Influence of Breathing on Brain State: Kevin Yackle's Research (1:00:42)

- **Kevin Yackle's research:**  Identified a population of neurons in the pre-Botzinger complex that project to the locus coeruleus, a brain area involved in arousal, alertness, and mood. 
- **Slow Breathing in Mice:**  Training mice to breathe slowly for 30 minutes a day for 4 weeks reduced their fear response in a standard fear conditioning test, suggesting that slow breathing can modulate emotional states.
- **Brain Rhythms and Breathing:**  The influence of breathing on brain state and emotion may be partly mediated through respiratory modulation of brain rhythms, specifically in the pre-Botzinger complex.

### Brain States and Breathing: A Two-Way Street (1:11:00)

- **Amygdala and Breathing:**  Stimulation of the amygdala, a brain area involved in fear processing, can produce profound changes in breathing patterns.
- **Locked-in Syndrome:**  Patients with locked-in syndrome, who have lost volitional control of most muscles, retain the ability to breathe but cannot voluntarily alter their breathing patterns. However, their breathing patterns can change in response to emotional cues, like humor.
- **Emotional Control of Breathing:**  This suggests that breathing can be influenced by both volitional control and emotional states, which operate through distinct neural pathways.

### The Locus Coeruleus and Alertness (1:19:00)

- **Yackle's findings:** Ablation of neurons projecting from the pre-Botzinger complex to the locus coeruleus in mice led to a calming effect and changes in EEG patterns indicative of reduced arousal.
- **Bidirectional Control:**  These findings further demonstrate the bidirectional relationship between breathing and brain state:  breathing can influence arousal, and conversely, arousal states can influence breathing.

### Nasal Breathing and Memory: Exploring the Mechanistic Basis (1:40:41)

- **Research Findings:**  Studies show that nasal breathing may enhance memory recall, particularly for olfactory memories, and increase hippocampal activity. 
- **Possible Mechanisms:**  The olfactory system plays a major role in nasal breathing, and its connection to the hippocampus could explain the observed memory benefits. The respiratory modulation of brain rhythms during nasal breathing might also contribute.
- **Further Research:**  Additional research is needed to differentiate the specific roles of nasal breathing and other respiratory signals in memory and cognitive processes.

### Breath Holds, Apnea, and Episodic Hypoxia: Exploring the Impact on Brain State (1:29:40)

- **Breath Holds:**  Holding your breath, whether consciously or unconsciously, can significantly alter CO2 levels in the blood.
- **Episodic Hypoxia:**  Alternating short periods of hypoxia (low oxygen) with normoxia (normal air) has been shown to improve motor function and cognitive performance. 
- **Cyclic Hyperventilation:**  Practices like Tummo and Wim Hof breathwork involve alternating periods of hyperventilation and breath holds, which may partially mimic the effects of episodic hypoxia.
- **Hyperbaric Chambers:**  While hyperbaric chambers increase oxygen levels, their effects on brain state and cognitive function are not well understood. 

### Breathing Practice for Mental and Physical Optimization (1:57:13)

- **Dr. Feldman's Breathwork Protocol:**  Dr. Feldman practices box breathing for 5-10 minutes, often after lunch, to improve focus and reduce post-lunch performance decline.
- **Simplicity and Exploration:** He advocates for exploring different breathwork practices, starting with simple techniques and gradually incorporating more complex methods.
- **Transitions and Variability:**  Dr. Feldman emphasizes the potential benefits of introducing variability into breathwork practices, transitioning between different patterns and durations to enhance awareness of the relationship between breathing and internal state.

### Magnesium Threonate and Cognition (2:06:29)

- **Magnesium Threonate's Potential Cognitive Benefits:** Research suggests that magnesium threonate, a form of magnesium that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, can improve cognitive function and neuro-plasticity.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Magnesium threonate may enhance LTP (long-term potentiation), a process essential for strengthening connections between neurons, by reducing noise in neuronal activity.
- **Dr. Feldman's Personal Experience:**  Dr. Feldman takes a half dose of magnesium threonate and reports improvements in sleep and a slowing of cognitive decline.
