## Time Perception and Entrainment: Dopamine, Serotonin, and Hormones

## Key Takeaways
1. **Entrainment:** Our internal processes (biology and psychology) are constantly entrained to external events.
2. **Circannual Entrainment:** Our brains and bodies are attuned to the Earth's year-long cycle around the sun, influencing hormone levels (melatonin, testosterone, estrogen) and mood.
3. **Circadian Entrainment:** Our cells have 24-hour rhythms, influenced by light exposure, and disruptions to this entrainment can lead to various health problems.
4. **Ultradian Entrainment:** 90-minute cycles influence our ability to focus and work.
5. **Dopamine and Time Overestimation:** Dopamine increases the "frame rate" of our perception, leading us to overestimate how much time has passed.
6. **Serotonin and Time Underestimation:** Serotonin decreases the frame rate, leading to underestimation of time.
7. **Time of Day and Tasks:** Dopamine is higher earlier in the day, making us better at rigid tasks, while serotonin dominates later, enhancing creativity.
8. **Blinking and Time Perception:** Blinking acts as a shutter, influencing our time perception.
9. **Cold Exposure and Dopamine:** Cold exposure increases dopamine, slowing down our perception of discomfort.
10. **Habits and Time Perception:** Habits can serve as dopamine markers, helping us divide our day into functional units.

## Introduction
This episode delves into the science of time perception, explaining how our brains and bodies are entrained to external rhythms, from yearly cycles to 90-minute intervals. It also reveals the roles of dopamine, serotonin, and other neuromodulators in shaping our subjective experience of time.  Dr. Huberman provides actionable advice and strategies for manipulating time perception to enhance focus, productivity, and well-being.

### Circannual Entrainment and Melatonin [0:09:25]
- **Circannual Rhythms:** Our brains and bodies have internal calendars, adjusting to the Earth's yearly cycle around the sun.
- **Light Inhibition of Melatonin:** Light inhibits the release of melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep and regulates other hormones.
- **Day Length and Melatonin:** Longer days result in less melatonin, potentially contributing to higher energy levels in the spring. Shorter days, conversely, lead to more melatonin.
- **Skin as an Endocrine Organ:** Exposure to sunlight on the skin, not just the eyes, impacts testosterone and estrogen levels, influencing mood, energy, and social behavior.

### Circadian Entrainment and Practical Tools [0:16:06]
- **Circadian Clock:** This internal 24-hour rhythm resides in the roof of the mouth, regulating gene expression and cellular activity.
- **Entrainment to the Light-Dark Cycle:** Our circadian clocks are entrained to the external light-dark cycle, ensuring our cells' 24-hour rhythms align.
- **Circadian Entrainment Tools:**
    - **Bright Light Exposure:** 10-30 minutes of bright light (ideally sunlight) within an hour of waking and again in the afternoon/evening.
    - **Avoid Bright Light at Night:** Minimize exposure to artificial light, especially blue light, in the evening.
    - **Regular Physical Activity:** Exercise at consistent times each day.
    - **Consistent Eating Window:** Eating within a similar time frame each day, even if meal times vary slightly.
    - **Ultradian Rhythms:** 90-minute cycles that govern focus, alertness, and performance.
    - **Initiating Ultradian Cycles:** These cycles can be initiated consciously, allowing for periods of focused work.
    - **Deliberate Cold Exposure:** Cold exposure increases dopamine levels, influencing time perception.
    - **Habits as Time Markers:** Habits, through dopamine release, serve as markers for the passage of time, dividing our day into functional units.

### Time Perception: Past, Present, and Future [0:31:42]
- **Types of Time Perception:**
    - **Present Time:** Our immediate experience of the passage of time, like an interval timer.
    - **Prospective Time:**  Measuring time intervals into the future, similar to a stopwatch.
    - **Retrospective Time:** Remembering and evaluating the duration of events in the past.
- **Neuromodulators and Frame Rate:** Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin control the "frame rate" of our perception, influencing how we experience time.
- **Dopamine and Overestimation:** Dopamine leads to a faster frame rate, causing us to overestimate how much time has passed.
- **Serotonin and Underestimation:** Serotonin slows down the frame rate, causing us to underestimate how much time has passed.

### Time Perception Across the Day [0:39:10]
- **Dopamine and Norepinephrine Dominance:** These neuromodulators are more prevalent in the first half of the day, leading to a higher frame rate and better performance on rigid tasks.
- **Serotonin Dominance:** Serotonin is elevated later in the day, promoting a slower frame rate and better creative thinking.

### Trauma and Overclocking [0:44:38]
- **Overclocking:** High levels of dopamine and norepinephrine during traumatic events can cause a perception of time slowing down, leading to vivid and enduring memories.
- **Memory as Space-Time Recorder:** Our brains store memories based on the sequence and firing rate of neurons.
- **Trauma Treatment:**  Treatment often involves manipulating the "playback rate" of traumatic memories to lessen their emotional impact.

### Dopamine, Arousal, and Blinking [0:51:03]
- **Dopamine and Arousal:**  Dopamine is associated with states of heightened arousal, both positive and negative.
- **Blinking and Time Perception:** Blinking acts as a shutter, contributing to time perception and potentially influencing the frame rate.
- **Manipulating Blink Rate:**  Intentional blinking might impact time perception, though practical applications are unclear.

### Fun vs. Boredom and Time Perception [0:56:30]
- **Dopamine and Enjoyment:**  Fun, varied experiences lead to a fast perception of time in the moment, but those experiences are remembered as longer.
- **Low Dopamine and Boredom:** Boring events feel long in the moment but are remembered as shorter.

### Novelty and Time Perception [1:00:54]
- **Novelty and Place:**  The more novel experiences we have in a place, the longer we feel we've been there.
- **Novelty and People:**  Novel experiences with someone make them feel more familiar and as though we've known them longer.

### Dopamine Release and Time Bins [1:03:00]
- **Dopamine as a Time Marker:** Dopamine release serves as a marker for the beginning and end of time bins in our perception.
- **Dopamine Hits and Daily Segmentation:**  Habits, through dopamine release, can help us consciously or subconsciously divide our day into functional units.

### Tools for Manipulating Time Perception [1:11:58]
- **Structured Habits:** Use habits to trigger dopamine release and set time markers within your day.
- **Functional Units:** Segment your day into smaller or larger functional units based on dopamine release from habits.

### Book Recommendation: "Your Brain Is a Time Machine" [1:11:58]
- **Author:** Dean Buonomano, professor at UCLA and expert in the neuroscience and physics of time.
