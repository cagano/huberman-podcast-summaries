# Microplastics: Effects on Health and Reduction Strategies

## Key Takeaways
1. Microplastics and nanoplastics are ubiquitous, found in air, water, food, and human tissues.
2.  Correlative data link microplastic exposure to issues like irritable bowel syndrome, reduced testosterone, and cardiovascular plaque formation.  Causality remains to be definitively established in humans.
3.  Minimizing exposure involves reducing consumption of bottled water, canned soup, and certain packaged foods; using water filters and choosing alternative salt sources.
4.  Lifestyle interventions like increasing cruciferous vegetable intake (or sulforaphane supplementation), promoting sweating, and increasing fiber consumption may aid in microplastic excretion.
5.  Reducing clothing overconsumption and using microfiber-trapping laundry aids can help limit environmental microplastic release.
6. The impact of microplastics on neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and autism is currently unclear, though further research is needed.
7. Pregnant women and those with young children should prioritize minimizing microplastic exposure.


## Introduction
This Huberman Lab podcast episode explores the pervasive presence of microplastics and nanoplastics in our environment and their potential impact on human health.  Dr. Huberman reviews current research, highlighting both alarming findings and areas of uncertainty, and provides actionable strategies for minimizing exposure and promoting detoxification.

### Microplastics and Nanoplastics: Ubiquity and Size [0:05:40]
- Microplastics range from 1 micron to 5 millimeters in diameter; nanoplastics are smaller than 1 micron.
- They are found in air, water, food, and many consumer products.
-  While the body has detoxification mechanisms, microplastics can lodge in tissues for extended periods.
- Discrepancies exist in data regarding the quantity of microplastics ingested weekly.

### Microplastics in Human Tissues [0:09:38]
- Studies show microplastics in various human tissues, including the brain, testes, and follicles (crossing blood-organ barriers).
-  The presence of microplastics in the placenta and meconium raises concerns about fetal exposure.
-  Correlations exist between microplastic presence and certain health issues, but causality remains unclear.
-  BPA (bisphenol A), a component of some plastics, is a known endocrine disruptor.

### Sources of Microplastic Exposure and Reduction Strategies [0:19:21]
- **Bottled Water:** Contains a significant amount of microplastics; using reusable containers is recommended.
- **Tap Water:**  Also contains microplastics; reverse osmosis filters can remove them but are costly.
- **Sea Salt:**  Avoid sea salt in favor of Himalayan or other non-marine sources.
- **Canned Soup:**  Lined with BPA, which leaches into the soup; avoid or seek BPA-free alternatives.  Consider BPS and phthalates as well.
- **Plastic Containers & Microwaves:** Avoid microwaving food in plastic containers.
- **Paper Cups:** Linings in paper cups used for hot liquids often contain BPA and BPS; using reusable mugs is advisable.


## Practical Advice and Strategies

- **Reduce bottled water consumption:** Use reusable, non-plastic water bottles. [0:19:21]
- **Filter tap water:** Consider a reverse osmosis filter to remove microplastics. [0:19:21]
- **Choose alternative salt:** Opt for Himalayan pink salt or other non-marine salts. [0:26:57]
- **Limit canned soup intake:** Choose fresh soup or look for BPA-free alternatives. [0:30:40]
- **Avoid microwaving in plastic:** Use glass or ceramic containers. [0:34:55]
- **Use reusable mugs:** Avoid paper cups lined with BPA and BPS. [0:34:55]
- **Increase cruciferous vegetable intake:**  Eat broccoli, cauliflower, etc., or consider sulforaphane supplementation. [1:00:02]
- **Increase fiber intake:** Consume plenty of fruits, vegetables, and starches. [1:08:32]
- **Promote sweating:** Utilize saunas, hot baths, or exercise to encourage toxin removal. [1:15:05]
- **Reduce clothing consumption:**  Reuse clothing and use microfiber-trapping laundry aids. [1:18:21]
- **Limit packaged food:** Use reusable containers or shop at farmers' markets. [1:18:21]
- **Consider alternative toothpaste:** Opt for tooth tablets to avoid microplastics in tubes. [1:25:11]
- **Avoid microwave popcorn:**  Look for alternatives due to potential for microplastic and endocrine disruptor contamination. [1:25:11]
- **Use nitrile gloves when handling receipts:** Minimize BPA absorption through skin. [1:32:19]
