## How to Shape Your Identity and Goals: A Conversation with Maya Shankar

## Key Takeaways
- **Identity is shaped by observation and imposed structures:** We learn from those around us, and early influences can lead to "identity foreclosure," limiting our potential.
- **Anchor identity to "why" instead of "what":** Define yourself by your values and motivations rather than your occupation or specific achievements.
- **Awe can inspire a sense of self:** Experiences that evoke awe, whether positive or negative, can open us to new possibilities and redefine our sense of who we can be.
- **Curiosity fuels growth:** Embrace a lifelong curiosity to continually learn and explore new areas, regardless of external pressures or past identities.
- **Cognitive closure can hinder change:** Reducing our need for definitive answers and embracing uncertainty can increase well-being and resilience in the face of change. 

## Introduction

In this episode, neuroscientist Andrew Huberman sits down with cognitive scientist Dr. Maya Shankar, former senior advisor to the White House and creator of the podcast 'A Slight Change of Plans'. They delve into the science of identity, motivation, and goal setting, examining how we form our sense of self, how to redefine ourselves when faced with change, and how to cultivate a more fulfilling and purposeful life.

### Identity Formation & Recreating Self (0:05:15)
- **Identity foreclosure:** Early influences, particularly from parents, can shape our identity in limiting ways.
- **Identity paralysis:** Loss of a defining activity can lead to feelings of confusion and stagnation, questioning one's purpose and value.
- **Throughline:**  Identify the core values and motivations that drive your actions, and seek to express them in new ways after change.
- **Example:** Dr. Shankar's experience with losing her ability to play violin due to injury, and finding human connection as a throughline in her new endeavors.

### Identity & Adolescence (0:12:10)
- **Adolescent identity exploration:** The brain undergoes changes during adolescence, leading to a greater desire for independence and questioning of one's self.
- **Essentialism:** The belief in immutable qualities that define us can lead to feelings of shame and a fixed mindset.
- **Growth mindset:** Embrace the idea that our identities are constantly evolving, based on our thoughts and behaviors.

### Delight & Awe (0:16:58)
- **Delight vs. Awe:** While awe inspires wonder, delight is a feeling of engagement and possibility, fueled by the potential to actively participate in and shape the experience.
- **Awe-inspiring experiences:** Characterized by perceived vastness (physical or conceptual) and a need for accommodation (integrating new information into our existing mental model). 
- **Example:** Dr. Shankar's experience with Beethoven's Violin Concerto, inspiring both awe and the realization of the power of music to shape emotion. 

### Intrinsic Motivation & Juilliard (0:29:28)
- **Intrinsic motivation:**  Finding and nurturing natural passions, without external pressure or benchmarks, fosters deeper engagement and enjoyment.
- **Example:** Dr. Shankar's early violin journey, fueled by intrinsic motivation and supported by her parents' encouragement of exploration.
- **Role models & pressure:** Early success can create a high bar for achievement, leading to feelings of inadequacy and hindering progress.
- **Imaginative courage:** Be willing to take risks and embrace opportunities outside of comfort zones, even when unprepared.

### Competitive Environments & Growth (0:45:43)
- **Comparison & self-criticism:**  Highly competitive environments can lead to constant benchmarking and self-doubt, undermining intrinsic motivation.
- **Source:** Returning to the core reasons for pursuing an activity, independent of external metrics, provides a sense of protection and meaning.

### Re-Creating of Self (0:53:46)
- **The impact of loss:** Loss of a defining activity or relationship can create a sense of profound identity loss and disorientation.
- **Reframing after loss:**  Find new avenues to express your core values and motivations, even if they are not identical to past experiences. 
- **Example:** Dr. Shankar's journey after her violin injury, finding renewed purpose and joy in cognitive science.

### Pop-Science & Science Accessibility (1:00:51)
- **Pop-science books:**  Can play a critical role in inspiring interest in science and making complex concepts accessible to a broader audience.
- **Value of accessibility:** Making science accessible through pop-science writing and initiatives like the Huberman Lab podcast can foster a love of learning and attract diverse minds to scientific pursuits.

### Passions & Curiosity (1:06:32)
- **Shifting passions:** Recognizing that excitement in a new area may be different from past passions, and allowing for a new quality of enjoyment.
- **Curiosity as a driver:** Cultivate curiosity as a primary motivator, fostering a desire to learn and explore new frontiers without being attached to a specific outcome.

### Change, Cognitive Closure, & The End of History Illusion (1:13:20)
- **Cognitive closure:** The need for definitive answers can lead to resistance to change and a fear of uncertainty.
- **The End of History Illusion:** We often underestimate how much we will change in the future, based on our current self-perception.
- **Auditing self through change:**  Continuously assess how our identities evolve in response to life experiences.

### Self-Awareness & Critical Feedback (1:22:29)
- **Incomplete self-knowledge:** We often lack full awareness of our strengths, weaknesses, and how we impact others.
- **Diverse perspectives:** Seek feedback from individuals with different viewpoints to gain a more comprehensive understanding of ourselves.
- **Value of critical feedback:** Embrace critical feedback, even from those who disagree with us, as a valuable tool for growth and self-improvement.

### Tools: Flexible Mindset, Reframing, Venting, Gratitude (1:30:48)
- **Flexible mindset:** Cultivate a willingness to change opinions and beliefs based on new information and feedback.
- **Third person perspective:** Distance yourself from your emotional response by viewing your problems from a third person perspective, increasing objectivity.
- **Cognitive advisor vs. venting:** Instead of venting, seek a cognitive advisor who will challenge your perspective and help you find reframing strategies.
- **Importance of gratitude:** Recognize and internalize gratitude, both given and received, to amplify positive experiences and cultivate a more positive outlook.

### Tool: Framing Goals (1:40:13)
- **Approach vs. avoidance goals:** Frame goals in terms of what you want to achieve (approach) rather than what you want to avoid (avoidance), which is generally more motivating.
- **Ownership of goals:**  Feeling agency over your goals, even with coaching and guidance, increases motivation and satisfaction.
- **The endowment effect:**  Emphasize what you have earned through effort and commitment, rather than just eligibility, to increase motivation.

### Tool: Agency in Goal Pursuit (1:47:13)
- **The power of agency:**  Allowing individuals to set their own targets and make choices within their goal pursuit fosters a sense of control and intrinsic motivation.
- **The importance of choice:**  Provide a range of options for goal attainment, empowering individuals to feel ownership over their path.

### Tool: Like-Minded People & Goal Pursuit (1:52:25)
- **Benefits of like-minded groups:**  Sharing goals and challenges with like-minded individuals can provide encouragement and support.
- **Dangers of groupthink:**  Be mindful of the tendency to revert to the mean in thinking and opinions within like-minded groups. 
- **Challenging beliefs:** Use thought experiments to challenge your own beliefs and assumptions, imagining how your worldview might be different in other contexts.

### Tool: Aversion & Memory, Peak-End Rule (2:24:55)
- **Peak-end rule:** Our memories of experiences are shaped by the most intense emotional moments and the ending.
- **Minimizing aversion:**  Ending unpleasant activities on a slightly more positive note, even if it extends the overall duration, can make us more likely to repeat them.

### Tool: “Middle Problem”, Maintaining Motivation (2:19:54)
- **The Middle Problem:**  Motivation often declines during the middle stages of goal pursuit.
- **Shorten timeframes:** Set smaller, shorter-term goals to minimize the "middle" period and maintain momentum.
- **Temptation bundling:** Pair unpleasant activities with enjoyable ones that are only allowed in this context, creating a positive association.
