## Using Hypnosis to Enhance Health & Performance 

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hypnosis is a unique state of highly focused attention that can enhance control over mind and body.**  It involves turning down activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC), a conflict detector, and increasing functional connectivity between the DACC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region in the executive control network.
2. **Hypnosis can be used for a wide range of issues including stress reduction, sleep improvement, pain management, phobia treatment, and trauma recovery.**  Clinical and self-hypnosis have been shown to be effective, often producing rapid and long-lasting changes.
3. **Hypnotizability is a measurable trait that influences the effectiveness of hypnosis.**  The Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, a simple test, can help gauge hypnotizability.
4. **EMDR may incorporate elements of hypnosis but the lateralized eye movements may not be crucial for its therapeutic effects.**  EMDR is likely a form of exposure-based therapy.
5. **Confronting stress and trauma is essential for processing and healing.**  The process of confronting and re-experiencing a traumatic event can help to restructure the neural networks associated with it.
6. **The mind-body connection is complex and dynamic.**  Hypnosis can be used to either unify or uncouple the mind and body, depending on the therapeutic goal.
7. **Breathing plays a key role in shifting brain states.**  Specific breathing patterns can increase or decrease sympathetic arousal and can be used as an adjunct to hypnotic protocols.
8. **Hypnosis is not a replacement for traditional therapies or medications, but it can be a powerful complement.**  It may even be more effective than traditional approaches in some cases.

## Introduction

In this episode, Dr. Andrew Huberman welcomes Dr. David Spiegel, a leading expert in clinical hypnosis and professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. They discuss the science behind hypnosis, its clinical applications, and practical strategies for self-hypnosis. Dr. Spiegel shares his own experience with hypnosis, as well as his research on the neurobiology of the hypnotic state, and how it can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including stress, pain, insomnia, and trauma.

### The Nature of Hypnosis (0:09:09)

- **Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention, similar to being completely immersed in a movie or sports game.**  It involves a narrowing of context and a temporary suspension of critical judgment.
- **Clinical hypnosis is different from stage hypnosis.**  Clinical hypnosis involves guiding individuals to change their brain state and use that state to make beneficial adjustments in their brain, body, and psychology.

### Stage Hypnosis vs. Clinical Hypnosis (0:16:45)

- **Stage hypnotists often select individuals who are highly hypnotizable and exploit their suggestibility for entertainment purposes.**  This can sometimes have negative consequences, as individuals may enter a trance-like state and experience distressing emotions or sensations.
- **Self-hypnosis is a way of enhancing control over mind and body.**  It allows for greater cognitive flexibility and the ability to see things from different perspectives.

### The Neurobiology of Hypnosis (0:20:25)

- **Entering a hypnotic state involves specific changes in brain activity.**  These changes include:
    - **Decreased activity in the DACC**, reducing distractibility.
    - **Increased functional connectivity between the DACC and the DLPFC**, facilitating goal-oriented behavior and reducing interference from other thoughts.
    - **Increased functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the insula**, allowing for greater control over bodily functions.
    - **Inverse functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex**, facilitating dissociation and reducing self-awareness.

### ADHD and Hypnosis (0:26:04)

- **People with ADHD may have disruptions in the salience network and the executive control network.**  These disruptions can lead to distractibility and difficulty focusing.
- **Hypnosis may be helpful for enhancing focus and attention, but further research is needed to determine its effectiveness for ADHD.**

### Hypnosis for Stress and Sleep (0:28:22)

- **Hypnosis can be a powerful tool for stress reduction and sleep improvement.**  It can help to dissociate somatic reactions from psychological reactions, allowing individuals to maintain a sense of control over their bodies in the face of stress.
- **Self-hypnosis can be used during both the daytime and at bedtime.**  This can help to strengthen neural connections associated with relaxation and improved sleep.

### Restructuring Trauma Narratives (0:37:19)

- **Hypnosis can be used to facilitate the restructuring of traumatic memories and the associated neural networks.**  This can help to reduce the intensity of negative emotions and improve coping mechanisms.
- **Hypnosis can help individuals re-experience a trauma in a safe and controlled environment, allowing for greater cognitive flexibility and emotional regulation.**

### Ketamine Therapy and Dissociation (0:45:14)

- **Ketamine, a dissociative drug, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of depression and PTSD.**  It works by inducing a dissociative state, which may help to re-process traumatic memories and reduce the intensity of negative emotions.
- **Dissociation during a traumatic event is an adaptive strategy, but it can also impede healing.**  Ketamine and hypnosis may help individuals re-engage with dissociated memories in a safe and controlled environment.

### Self-directed Hypnosis and the Reveri App (0:50:07)

- **Hypnosis can often produce rapid and long-lasting changes.**  However, it may be necessary to follow up with a clinician or use self-hypnosis to reinforce the therapeutic effects.
- **The Reveri app is a self-hypnosis app developed by Dr. Spiegel's lab that uses clinically validated protocols for stress reduction, sleep improvement, pain management, focus, and healthy eating.**

### Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions, and Hypnotizability (0:56:53)

- **Individuals with OCD may be less hypnotizable, due to their rigid and controlling thought patterns.**
- **Superstitions may be more common among highly hypnotizable individuals, as their imagination can supplant reality.**
- **The Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, a simple test of eye movement, can help to gauge an individual's hypnotizability.**  This test involves tilting the head back, looking upward, and then closing the eyelids while maintaining upward eye gaze. If the eyes roll back and the sclera is visible, it indicates higher hypnotizability.

### EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing) (1:15:36)

- **EMDR may incorporate elements of hypnosis, particularly in its use of lateralized eye movements to suppress amygdala activity.**
- **However, the lateralized eye movements may not be essential for the therapeutic effects of EMDR.**  EMDR is likely a form of exposure-based therapy.

### Confronting Stress & Trauma (1:21:43)

- **Confronting stress and trauma is crucial for processing and healing.**  This can involve deliberately re-experiencing the event in a safe and controlled environment, allowing for greater emotional regulation and a restructuring of the neural networks associated with the trauma.
- **Trigger warnings may be counterproductive, as they can create a sense of fragility and hinder the development of resilience.**

### The Mind-Body Connection (1:27:56)

- **The mind-body connection is complex and dynamic.**  It involves both the integration and the separation of mental and physical experiences.
- **Hypnosis can be used to unify or uncouple the mind and body, depending on the therapeutic goal.**  For example, it can be used to help individuals feel their thoughts or think their feelings.

### Dealing with Grief (1:31:35)

- **Grief is a natural and necessary stage of life, involving the comprehension of an incomprehensible loss.**  Rituals and mourning practices help to process and make sense of the loss.
- **Hypnosis can be used to help individuals explore their grief, while simultaneously focusing on the positive aspects of their relationship with the deceased.**

### Hypnosis in Children and Groups (1:35:45)

- **Children can be highly hypnotizable and can benefit from clinical and self-hypnosis.**  Pediatricians and dentists often use hypnosis to help children cope with medical procedures and dental anxiety.
- **Hypnosis can be used effectively in group settings.**  This can create a shared social experience and enhance individuals' hypnotic responses.

### Drug Therapies and Hypnosis (1:40:06)

- **Hypnosis may have a sedative effect, possibly due to increased GABA activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.**
- **Benzodiazepines may enhance hypnotic responsiveness in highly anxious individuals, but they can inhibit it in individuals who are not anxious.**
- **Hypnosis is often a more effective and safer alternative to medications.**  It can be used as a replacement for medication or as a complementary therapy.

### Breathing Patterns and Peak Performance (1:42:39)

- **Breathing is a powerful tool for shifting brain states.**  Specific breathing patterns can induce sympathetic arousal or parasympathetic activity.
- **Slow exhaling can enhance relaxation and improve hypnotic responses.**
- **Hypnosis can be used to enhance peak performance in areas such as athletics and music.**  This involves entering a state of focused attention and letting go of conscious control.
