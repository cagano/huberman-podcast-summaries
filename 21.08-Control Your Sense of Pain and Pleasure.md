## Control Your Sense of Pain and Pleasure

## Key Takeaways
1. **Dopamine is the molecule of motivation and anticipation, not pleasure.**  Harnessing dopamine through intermittent reward schedules can lead to sustained motivation. 
2. **Our experience of pain is subjective and influenced by factors like expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genetics.** Understanding these factors can help us manage pain and maximize pleasure.
3. **Cold receptors respond to relative changes in temperature, making a quick, full immersion in cold water more comfortable.**
4. **Heat receptors respond to absolute changes in temperature, so gradually entering a hot environment is more comfortable.**
5. **The brain's representation of our bodies is plastic and can be rewired through experiences, such as phantom limb phenomena.** This highlights the brain's role in shaping our perceptions of pain and pleasure.
6. **Acupuncture, especially electroacupuncture, can have both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects depending on the location and intensity of stimulation.** Understanding these mechanisms can help us identify responders and optimize treatment.
7. **Hypnosis, particularly self-hypnosis, can effectively manage pain by altering our interpretation of sensory experiences.** The Reveri app offers a free, science-backed resource for self-hypnosis.
8. **Applying pressure above and below a painful site can provide relief by activating A fibers, which inhibit pain-signaling C fibers.** This is based on the "Gate Theory of Pain."
9. **PEA (Phenethylamine) can enhance the perception of pleasure by amplifying the effects of dopamine and serotonin.**
10. **Controlling pleasure by managing dopamine levels through intermittent reward schedules can help maintain motivation and prevent habituation.**

### Dopamine, Motivation & Intermittent Reward Schedules (0:01:50)

- **Dopamine is not the "pleasure molecule," but a molecule of motivation and anticipation.** It is released in anticipation of a reward, driving us to work towards it.
- **Reward prediction error (variance) explains dopamine release:** When a reward is expected and received, dopamine levels drop to baseline. However, if the reward is delivered intermittently, dopamine levels increase significantly, leading to greater motivation and focus.
- **Actionable advice:** Apply the principle of intermittent reward schedules in your daily life to sustain motivation. Avoid rewarding every action or goal, and incorporate random delays in reward delivery.

### Sensing Pain and Pleasure: Skin, DRGs, and Brain (0:12:04)

- **Skin is the largest organ in the body and harbors neurons called DRGs (dorsal root ganglia) that detect stimuli.** These neurons send information from the skin to the spinal cord and then to the brain.
- **DRGs respond to various stimuli including light touch, pressure, temperature, and chemicals.** The electrical signals sent by these neurons are the same regardless of the stimulus, but the brain interprets them based on prior experiences and innate mechanisms.
- **Somatosensory cortex contains a map of the body surface called the homunculus.** Areas of the body with higher sensory innervation are magnified on this map. 

### The Subjective Nature of Pain and Pleasure (0:18:13)

- **Our experience of pain is not simply a reflection of physical damage.** Factors like expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genetics can significantly modulate our perception of pain.
- **Expectation and anxiety can amplify or reduce pain perception depending on the timing of the warning.** A 20-40 second warning is optimal for preparing for a painful stimulus, but a shorter or longer warning can actually make pain worse.
- **Pain threshold varies significantly across individuals.**  Even among medical professionals, the subjective experience of pain can differ greatly, impacting patient care and treatment decisions.

### Cold Sensing: Relative Changes in Temperature (0:40:27)

- **Cold receptors in the skin respond to relative drops in temperature, not absolute temperature.**  Therefore, getting into cold water quickly is more comfortable than a slow gradual entry.
- **Actionable advice:** To minimize discomfort, get into cold water quickly and fully immerse yourself up to the neck.**

### Heat Sensing: Absolute Changes in Temperature (0:45:22)

- **Heat receptors respond to absolute changes in temperature.**  Gradually entering a hot environment is more comfortable and safer than a sudden exposure.

### Pain is Subjective: Perception vs. Damage (0:48:10)

- **The degree of physical damage does not always correlate with our experience of pain.** For example, x-rays can cause tissue damage but are not perceived as painful, while a perceived injury (like a nail through the boot) can create intense pain even if no physical damage occurred.
- **Our visual system plays a critical role in our pain perception.** We interpret pain based on visual cues and prior experience.

### The Plasticity of Pain: Phantom Limb Phenomena (0:52:04)

- **Phantom limb phenomena demonstrate the plasticity of the brain's body representation (homunculus).** When a limb is amputated, the brain's representation of that limb can remain, leading to sensations of movement and even pain in the missing limb.
- **Mirror box therapy, developed by V.S. Ramachandran, utilizes visual feedback to rewire the homunculus and reduce phantom limb pain.**  It involves visually "re-integrating" the missing limb by using a mirror to reflect the intact limb, creating the illusion of two symmetric limbs.

### The Merged Experience of Sensory Regions (0:58:08)

- **Because of the close proximity of certain body part representations in the homunculus, sensations from different areas can become merged.**  A classic example is a patient who experienced orgasm in their phantom foot, highlighting the interconnected nature of sensory maps in the brain.

### Whole Body Pain and "Syndromes" (1:01:00)

- **The term "syndrome" signifies a constellation of symptoms that point towards a potential underlying condition but lacks a definitive diagnosis.**
- **"Psychosomatic" does not mean "all in your head" but reflects the neural nature of both physical and psychological experiences.** There is a neurological basis for psychosomatic phenomena like psychogenic fever, where mental stress can trigger physical symptoms.
- **Fibromyalgia, a type of whole body pain, is no longer considered solely a "syndrome" but is now understood to have a biological basis.**  It is associated with the activation of glial cells and their toll 4 receptors.

### Treatments for Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain (1:04:40)

- **Low-dose naltrexone, a medication used for opioid addiction, has shown potential in treating fibromyalgia by blocking toll 4 receptors on glial cells.** 
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine, an over-the-counter supplement, has been shown to reduce pain in conditions like fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy.** It may also improve peripheral nerve health generally.
- **Agmatine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) have also been studied for their potential pain-relieving properties.**
- **5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is a more bioavailable alternative to SAMe, promoting the endogenous production of SAMe.**

### The Mechanism of Acupuncture (1:17:27)

- **Acupuncture can effectively manage certain forms of pain, but there are significant variations in response.** Some individuals experience substantial pain relief while others do not.
- **Electroacupuncture, a type of acupuncture that involves electrical stimulation, activates different neural circuits depending on the location of stimulation.** Stimulation of the abdomen can either reduce or exacerbate inflammation, while stimulation of the legs can be anti-inflammatory.

### Hypnosis for Pain Management (1:28:20)

- **Hypnosis, particularly self-hypnosis, is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for chronic and acute pain.** It modulates brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and insula, altering our interpretation of sensory experiences.
- **The Reveri app offers free, science-backed self-hypnosis scripts based on the work of Dr. David Spiegel.**

### The Gate Theory of Pain and Pressure-Based Relief (1:30:00)

- **The Gate Theory of Pain explains how applying pressure above or below a painful site can provide relief.** This involves activating A fibers, which inhibit pain-signaling C fibers.
- **This principle is evident in instinctive actions like rubbing a wound or applying tape above an injury.**

### Redheads and Pain Thresholds (1:37:53)

- **Redheads have a higher pain threshold, on average, due to their MC1R gene.** This gene is associated with increased production of beta endorphins, endogenous opioids that reduce pain perception.

### Love and Pain Thresholds (1:44:02)

- **Research suggests that obsessive love can increase pain tolerance.** This is likely due to the release of dopamine associated with infatuation, which can modulate brain areas involved in pain perception and inflammation.

### Pleasure: Dopamine, Serotonin, and Oxytocin (1:49:23)

- **The experience of pleasure serves an adaptive role in reproduction and is mediated by multiple neurochemical systems.**
- **Dopamine is primarily associated with anticipation and motivation for pleasure, while serotonin is linked to the immediate experience of pleasure.**
- **Oxytocin, associated with pair bonding and feelings of warmth and safety, is also involved in the pleasure system.**

### PEA: Augmenting Pleasure Perception (1:51:40)

- **PEA (Phenethylamine), a molecule found in dark chocolate and sometimes taken as a supplement, can amplify the experience of pleasure.**
- **This effect is likely due to PEA's ability to increase the activity of neural circuits involved in pleasure.**

### Tonic Levels of Dopamine and Serotonin (1:55:40)

- **Maintaining sufficient tonic (baseline) levels of dopamine and serotonin is crucial for experiencing pleasure.** Low levels can lead to anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure) and depression.
- **Antidepressants like Wellbutrin and SSRIs increase dopamine and serotonin, respectively, by raising baseline levels.**

### The Relationship Between Pleasure and Pain (1:59:40)

- **A surge in dopamine is often accompanied by a corresponding increase in the brain circuits associated with disappointment and pain.** This is a protective mechanism to prevent habituation to pleasure and maintain a balance between reward and pain.
- **Repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine, especially through artificial means, can lead to a decline in dopamine peaks and an increase in pain perception.** This is a key factor in addiction.

### Managing Dopamine for Sustained Pleasure (2:01:24)

- **To maintain the capacity for experiencing pleasure over time, avoid excessive dopamine peaks and utilize intermittent reward schedules.** 
- **Actionable advice:**  Minimize the frequency and magnitude of rewards, and remove rewards at random intervals to prevent habituation and maintain motivation.

### Immediate, Non-Goal-Directed Pleasure (2:06:40)

- **The immediate, visceral experience of pleasure is distinct from goal-directed behavior and is more closely associated with the serotonin system.**
- **The periaqueductal gray (PAG) area in the brain releases endogenous opioids, providing a sense of bliss in response to certain experiences like sexual activity, exercise, and childbirth.**

### Touch and Directionality (2:08:40)

- **Certain neurons in the skin respond to the direction of touch.** This explains why we prefer to have our hair stroked in the direction of its growth.
- **Our sensitivity to touch and the perception of pleasure or discomfort are influenced by our overall level of arousal (alertness).** 

### Synthesis and Support (2:13:00)

- **The episode concludes by summarizing the key concepts regarding pain and pleasure, emphasizing the interconnectedness of brain circuits, subjective experience, and environmental influences.** 
- **The podcast encourages listeners to explore the provided resources and consider how to apply these principles in their own lives to manage pain and enhance pleasure.**
