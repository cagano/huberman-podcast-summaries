# Behaviors That Alter Your Genes to Improve Health and Performance

## Key Takeaways
1. Behaviors and environmental factors significantly modify gene expression, impacting health and performance across generations.
2. The mammalian dive reflex, triggered by cold water immersion and breath-holding, increases oxygen availability via spleen contraction.  This can be leveraged for performance enhancement, but caution is advised.
3. Mate selection is influenced by the unconscious drive to maximize offspring immune system diversity, detectable through scent.
4.  Populations like the Bajau and Haenyeo demonstrate rapid genetic adaptation to diving, showcasing larger spleens and altered cardiovascular responses.
5.  Genetic variations can lead to seemingly "superhuman" abilities, but training plays a significant role in realizing that potential.
6. Ethical considerations surrounding gene editing in humans are paramount, especially regarding "enhancement" versus "correction."
7. Mindset and belief significantly impact physiological outcomes, even overriding genetic predispositions in some cases.


## Introduction
This episode features Dr. Melissa Ilardo, a professor of biomedical informatics at the University of Utah, discussing the fascinating interplay between human genetics, epigenetics, and behavior. Dr. Ilardo explores how behaviors can modify gene expression, impacting not only individuals but also subsequent generations.  Specific examples include the mammalian dive reflex and mate selection preferences related to the immune system.

### Nature vs. Nurture & Gene Expression (0:02:35)
-  While some traits are genetically predetermined, a significant portion of our gene expression is modifiable through behavior and environment.
- Epigenetics involves modifications to the genome that alter gene expression and can be inherited.
-  Examples of rapid gene expression changes include eye color darkening with UV exposure.

### Epigenetics, Trauma, and Mate Attraction (0:10:24)
- Epigenetic changes due to trauma, starvation, etc., can be passed down through generations, sometimes increasing resilience but potentially having negative consequences in other environments.
- Mice and humans exhibit a preference for mates with different immune systems (MHC), maximizing offspring immune diversity.  This preference is partly mediated by scent.
- Globalization increases genetic mixing, leading to new combinations and potential health implications.

### Sea Nomads and the Mammalian Dive Reflex (0:25:28)
- The Bajau and Moken sea nomad populations demonstrate exceptional breath-holding abilities, diving to significant depths.
- The mammalian dive reflex, triggered by cold water immersion and breath-holding, involves heart rate slowing, peripheral vasoconstriction, and spleen contraction.
- Spleen contraction releases oxygen-rich red blood cells into circulation, providing a ~10% oxygen boost.  This effect is temporary.

### Cultural Traditions and Free Diving (0:32:52)
- The Bajau's diving skills are culturally transmitted, passed down through generations within family units.  Proficiency in diving likely correlates with reproductive success.
- They primarily spearfish and collect shellfish, sea cucumbers, and seaweed.

### Thyroid Hormone and Spleen Function (0:46:00)
- Genetic studies show that Bajau individuals have larger spleens linked to higher-than-average thyroid hormone levels.  This is not necessarily hyperthyroidism, but rather a higher-than-average level of the hormone.
- This higher thyroid hormone correlates with increased red blood cell production. In mice, this increased red blood cell production does not involve erythropoietin.
-  Possible implications for performance enhancement through short bursts of increased oxygen availability.

### Female Free Divers and Cardiovascular Health (1:05:07)
- The Haenyeo, Korean female free divers, exhibit exceptional cardiovascular adaptations.
- Divers show a dramatically slowed heart rate during dives (training adaptation), and a genetic adaptation involving lowered diastolic blood pressure.
- These adaptations are linked to their diving practices, especially diving throughout pregnancy, and may offer protection against hypertensive disorders.

### Genetics and Human Super Performance (1:19:03)
- Exceptional human performance in areas such as marathon running and mathematical ability may be linked to genetic factors combined with training.
- Populations exhibiting "superhuman" abilities often demonstrate adaptations at both the internal organ and external appearance level.  There may be unconscious mate selection based on these traits.


###  Genetics and Ethics (1:36:30)
- The ethical considerations of CRISPR technology for gene editing in human embryos are discussed. Concerns include off-target effects and the potential for enhancement versus correction.
-  Access to advanced genetic testing technologies is currently unequal, raising equity concerns.


### Admixture and Human Species Definition (1:44:36)
- Admixture refers to the mixing of different ancestral populations.
- The question of whether *homo sapiens* constitutes a single species is raised. While significant genetic diversity exists, defining the threshold for a new species remains complex. A single base pair difference can create noticeable phenotypic change.


## Practical Advice and Strategies
- **To potentially improve oxygen availability:** Briefly immerse your face in cold water (~50°F/10°C) while holding your breath (be extremely cautious and only attempt under expert supervision). Note: This is not a substitute for proper medical care.
- **To improve immune system function:** Consider incorporating regular swimming or cold water exposure (under careful guidance).
- **For enhanced sleep:** Address sleep apnea, if present, through proper posture, weight management, and potentially CPAP.
- **For performance enhancement:** Consider focusing on both training and mindset, recognizing that genetic predispositions don't determine ultimate outcomes.
