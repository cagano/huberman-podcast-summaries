# Smell, Taste, and Pheromone-Like Chemicals: Control Mechanisms

## Key Takeaways
1.  Sniffing (even nothing) 10-15 times enhances smell and taste sensitivity.
2.  Nasal breathing increases alertness and improves learning and memory.
3.  Taste receptors are not localized on the tongue, but are intermixed.  There may be a sixth taste receptor for fat.
4.  Chemicals from other people (tears, sweat) significantly impact our biology and behavior.
5.  Our sense of smell is a strong indicator of brain health and can aid in concussion recovery.
6.  Taste receptors are found in other tissues beyond the tongue, including the gonads.
7.  The Maillard reaction in cooking enhances the savory (umami) flavor and increases amino acid availability.


## Introduction

This Huberman Lab Podcast episode delves into the neuroscience and biology of chemical sensing, covering smell, taste, and the impact of chemicals produced by other humans.  It explores how these senses affect our biology, cognition, and even interpersonal relationships.

### How We Sense Chemicals [0:13:54]
-   We sense chemicals through our nose, mouth, eyes, and to a lesser extent, skin.
-   Volatile chemicals enter our nose through sniffing.
-   Chemicals in food and drink are detected by taste receptors on the tongue.
-   Other people release chemicals (possibly pheromones) that influence our biology and behavior.


### Smell: Mechanisms and Protocols [0:21:16]
-   Olfactory neurons in the nose detect odorants and send signals to the brain via three pathways: innate responses (e.g., threat detection), learned associations (memory), and a possible accessory olfactory pathway involved in pheromone detection (controversial in humans).
-   **Protocol 1: Sniffing Exercise [0:34:00]:**  Perform 10-15 sniffs of nothing, followed by smelling an object to enhance olfactory perception. This increases brain arousal and neuron sensitivity.
-   **Smell and Memory [0:24:40]:**  Smell is strongly linked to memory due to its ancient evolutionary origins.
-   **Smell as a Readout of Brain Health [0:43:45]:**  A diminished sense of smell can be an early indicator of brain health issues, including neurodegenerative diseases.  Olfactory neurons regenerate throughout life, and this process can be enhanced through exercise, blood flow, and dopamine.
-   **Regaining Lost Sense of Smell [0:43:45]:** Loss of smell after brain injury is often due to damage to the cribriform plate. Olfactory training can aid recovery.


### Taste: Mechanisms and Receptors [1:04:32]
-   Five basic tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami (savory).  A possible sixth taste receptor for fat is being investigated.
-   Taste receptors are not located in specific zones on the tongue, but are intermixed.
-   **Sweet:** Detects energy sources (sugars).
-   **Salty:** Detects electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium).
-   **Bitter:** Detects potentially poisonous substances; triggers the gag reflex.
-   **Umami:** Detects amino acids.
-   **Sour:** Detects spoiled or fermented foods; triggers a pucker response.
-   **Fat:**  A potential sixth taste, important for detecting energy-rich foods.
-  **Gut-Brain Connection [1:15:05]:** The mouth is the beginning of the digestive tract, and taste receptors in the mouth and gut interact with the brain to influence food cravings and dopamine release.
-   **Protocol 3: Miracle Fruit [1:41:37]:** Ingesting miracle fruit inverts the perception of sweet and sour, demonstrating the plasticity of taste perception.


### Chemical Signaling Between Individuals [0:17:28]
-   Chemicals in women's tears reduce testosterone and sexual arousal in men (research findings from *Science* magazine).
-   **Pheromones:** Although controversial in humans, there's evidence of chemical signaling influencing behavior and biology.  Examples include the Coolidge effect (in animals) and potential menstrual cycle synchronization in women.
-   **Protocol 4:  The Popcorn Test [0:59:48]:** Individual differences in odor perception are due to genetic variations in olfactory receptor genes.
-   **Recognizing Romantic Partners' Scent [1:49:19]:** People can often identify their romantic partners' scent with high accuracy, showcasing the power of olfactory discrimination in human relationships.
-   Women generally show superior olfactory discrimination compared to men, influenced by hormonal cycles.


### The Maillard Reaction [1:33:35]
-   The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs during cooking, creating savory flavors and browning.  It involves a reaction between sugars and amino acids.  The resulting ketones contribute to the overall aroma and taste of cooked foods.


## Practical Advice and Strategies

**For Enhanced Smell and Taste:**

*   Practice nasal breathing regularly.
*   Perform the sniffing exercise (Protocol 1) before experiencing the smell of food.
*   Train yourself to smell different foods and objects more intensely, paying attention to nuances.
*   Consider experimenting with miracle fruit to better understand the contribution of sweet to different food flavors.

**For Increased Alertness:**

*   Practice nasal breathing, especially during focused work.
*   Increase the intensity of your inhales.
