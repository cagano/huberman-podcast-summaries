# How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health, and Behavior

## Key Takeaways
1. Humans have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell, rivaling that of dogs.
2. We constantly smell ourselves and others, often subconsciously, to gather information about their emotional state, hormone levels, and even their immune system.
3. Our nostrils alternate in airflow every 2.5 hours on average, reflecting a dynamic balance in our autonomic nervous system, which can be influenced by stress and potentially used as a disease marker.
4. Smells are powerful triggers of memory, particularly those experienced early in life, and can influence our social interactions and romantic choices.
5. The olfactory system may play a role in unexplained repeated pregnancy loss, and further research is underway to explore this connection.

## Introduction
This episode features a conversation with Dr. Noam Sobel, a Professor of Neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel's lab studies olfaction (the sense of smell) and chemosensation, exploring how our brains process chemical signals from the world around us, including pheromones. The episode dives deep into the fascinating and often overlooked ways that smell shapes our behavior, emotions, health, and even our relationships.

### Olfaction: The Architecture of Smell (0:06:46)
- We smell through both our nose and our mouth via retronasal olfaction.
- About 7 million olfactory receptors are embedded in a convoluted sheet-like structure called the olfactory epithelium.
- Humans have approximately 350 different types of olfactory receptors, which are encoded by a significant portion of our genome.
- Odorants bind to these receptors, triggering a neural signal that travels through the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb.
- This signal then projects to various brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, influencing emotions, memory, and behavior.

### Smell and Memories (0:24:40)
- Smells are often linked to powerful and long-lasting memories.
- Early olfactory experiences, particularly during childhood, tend to create robust memory representations.
- The direct pathway from the olfactory bulb to the hippocampus, a key memory center, contributes to this strong olfactory-memory link.

### Humans as Odor Trackers (0:29:07)
- Humans are capable of following scent trails with surprising accuracy, especially when deprived of other sensory input.
- This ability can be significantly improved through training.
- The olfactory system is bilateral, meaning we have separate pathways on each side of the brain, which may contribute to our ability to track odors with greater precision using both nostrils.

### The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System (0:39:25)
- The alternating nasal cycle, where airflow through one nostril is dominant at a time, is a marker of autonomic nervous system balance.
- This cycle occurs on average every 2.5 hours and becomes more pronounced during sleep.
- The sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest) are thought to play a role in driving this cycle.
- Dr. Sobel's lab is researching the use of nasal airflow measurements as a disease marker, including for ADHD.

### Cognition and Breathing (0:48:18)
- Nasal inhalation appears to time and drive various cognitive processes, including visual spatial processing.
- Nasal breathing, as opposed to mouth breathing, may be beneficial for both cognition and overall health.
- Research suggests that the nasal cycle might not directly impact olfactory information processing in the brain.

### Neurodegenerative Diseases and Olfaction (0:54:47)
- Loss of smell is often an early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
- A theory suggests that Alzheimer's may be caused by a pathogen entering the brain through the olfactory system.
- Lack of smell testing in newborns makes it difficult to diagnose congenital anosmia, which affects about 0.5% of the population and is associated with various social and health challenges.

### Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals, and Social Sensing (1:06:19)
- Humans subconsciously gather information about others through chemosensation, including their body odor.
- Handshaking triggers a subconscious olfactory response, leading individuals to sniff their hands after shaking someone else's.
- This behavior is influenced by the odor perceived from the other person, with pleasant odors leading to more sniffing than unpleasant odors.
- This suggests a mechanism for subconscious social sensing through olfactory cues.

### Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others (1:15:07)
- We are constantly smelling ourselves and others, often without awareness, using this information to form social bonds.
- Studies have shown that people who smell similar are more likely to become friends ("click friendships").
- Our olfactory system plays a role in determining our perceptions of others, including attractiveness, likeability, and trustworthiness.

### Odors and Romantic Attraction (1:22:02)
- Mice prefer to mate with individuals whose immune system (MHC complex) is most different from their own, promoting offspring with greater immune diversity.
- Similar mechanisms may exist in humans, with individuals being attracted to partners whose body odor signals a diverse immune system.
- This may be related to a subconscious aversion to mating with close relatives, which increases the risk of genetic mutations.

### The Vomeronasal Organ, “Bruce Effect”, and Miscarriage (1:24:58)
- Most terrestrial mammals possess a vomeronasal organ (Jacobson's organ), which is thought to process pheromones.
- In mice, the vomeronasal organ mediates the Bruce effect, where exposure to a non-stud male's odor can trigger miscarriage in pregnant females.
- While humans have a vestigial vomeronasal organ, it is unclear if it is functional.
- A significant portion of human pregnancies end in miscarriage, and some of these may be linked to a potential remnant Bruce effect.
- Dr. Sobel's lab is investigating whether repeated pregnancy loss is associated with altered olfactory responses to male body odor.

### Social Chemo-Signals and Fear (1:40:20)
- Humans emit a specific body odor when in a state of fear, which can influence the autonomic arousal of others.
- The smell of fear is contagious, potentially explaining why dogs can detect human fear and why fear itself can be considered "contagious."
- This suggests a role for olfactory communication in social interactions and emotional contagion.

### Menstrual Cycle Synchronization (2:03:57)
- While anecdotal evidence suggests that menstrual cycles of co-housed women synchronize, scientific research has not provided conclusive evidence for this effect.
- The original study by Martha McClintock showed that exposure to sweat collected during different phases of the menstrual cycle could influence the cycle length of recipient women.
- However, later studies have challenged these findings, highlighting the complexity of studying cyclic events and the potential for confounding variables.
- Dr. Sobel's lab is planning a replication study to investigate this phenomenon further.

### Sweat, Tears, Emotions, and Testosterone (2:12:11)
-  Dr. Sobel's lab has conducted studies on the olfactory effects of emotional tears.
-  Emotional tears are odorless but can induce a significant drop in testosterone levels in both men and women.
-  This effect is rapid and pronounced, suggesting a powerful chemosensory mechanism influencing hormone regulation.
-  Sniffing tears may also reduce aggression in men, highlighting a potential role of olfactory communication in social and emotional behavior.

### Science, Politics, and the Pursuit of Truth (2:27:46)
- Dr. Sobel shares a personal anecdote about a failed attempt to replicate his lab's findings on the behavioral effects of tears, emphasizing the complexities and sometimes contentious nature of scientific research.
- The story highlights the importance of open collaboration and robust replication studies in ensuring the validity of scientific findings.
-  He also discusses the potential influence of ego and personal investment in research outcomes, reminding us that science, like any human endeavor, is not immune to biases and politics.

### Food Odors and Nutritional Value (2:37:54)
- Dr. Sobel discusses the potential for smells to convey information about the nutritional value of food beyond our conscious perception.
- He hypothesizes that our olfactory system may have evolved to seek out specific odor cues associated with essential nutrients, even if those nutrients themselves have no distinct smell.
- This suggests a potential connection between olfaction and the Obesity crisis, as processed foods often lack the complex olfactory signals associated with naturally occurring nutrients.

### Human Perception and Odorant Similarity (2:45:34)
- Despite the common misconception that smell is highly subjective, humans are remarkably similar in their olfactory perception.
- Studies show high levels of agreement on pleasantness ratings for odors, with outliers (like cilantro) accounting for the perception of individual differences.
- Our lack of precise olfactory language contributes to the illusion of subjectivity, as we lack the anchors that help us define and communicate shared sensory experiences.
- Dr. Sobel's lab has developed an algorithmic framework that can predict the perceptual similarity of molecular mixtures with high accuracy, paving the way for digitizing smell.

### Digitizing Smell: The Future of Olfactory Experiences (2:52:12)
-  The field of smell digitization is rapidly advancing, with companies like Google investing significant resources into developing "Google Smell" platforms.
-  Dr. Sobel's lab is actively working on creating an odor-generating device that can replicate any perceivable smell based on their algorithmic framework.
-  This technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including food engineering, dating apps, and medical diagnostics.
-  Once smell digitization reaches high resolution, it could become a powerful tool for non-invasive disease diagnosis and personalized healthcare.

### Final Thoughts: The Power of Smell (3:05:50)
- Dr. Sobel concludes by emphasizing the importance of olfaction research, highlighting its profound impact on our lives and the potential for its future applications.
- He emphasizes the need to continue exploring this powerful and often overlooked sense, recognizing its role in shaping our behavior, emotions, health, and even the evolution of human society.
