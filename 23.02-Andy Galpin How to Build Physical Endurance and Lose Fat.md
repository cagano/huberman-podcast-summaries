## How to Build Physical Endurance and Lose Fat with Andy Galpin, PhD

## Key Takeaways

1. **Endurance is about fatigue management and fueling.** It's not just about how long you can do something, but also how well you can manage fatigue and fuel your body effectively.
2. **Improving mechanics is key for enhancing endurance.** Optimizing breathing, posture, and movement technique can significantly improve endurance, particularly through nasal breathing.
3. **High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and steady-state exercise are both crucial for optimal endurance and fat loss.**  HIIT provides short bursts of intense exertion, while steady-state exercise helps build a foundation for longer durations. 
4. **Fat loss is primarily about carbon exchange.** You can lose fat by ingesting less carbon (calories) or expelling more carbon (through respiration). Exercise increases respiration rate, enhancing carbon expenditure.
5. **Metabolic flexibility is about efficiently using both carbohydrates and fat as fuel.** It's not about maximizing fat burning but rather optimizing fuel usage based on the situation.

## Introduction

This episode features Andy Galpin, PhD, a professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He joins Dr. Andrew Huberman to discuss the science and practical strategies behind endurance training and fat loss. They delve into the various types of endurance, the body's energy systems, and how different exercise modalities impact fuel utilization and fat loss.

### Endurance Categories & Fuel Systems (0:18:01)

- **Energy throughout the day:** A form of endurance where you maintain energy and feel great during daily activities.
- **Muscular endurance:** The ability to repeat a small effort in a muscle group without fatigue, such as walking up stairs or doing multiple repetitions of a strength training exercise.
- **Maximum anaerobic capacity:** The maximum amount of work you can perform at a high rate for 20 to 80 seconds, like sprinting up a hill or paddling hard in surfing.
- **Maximum aerobic capacity:** The ability to repeat an effort for 5 to 15 minutes, such as running a mile or a similar interval.
- **Sustained position:** Maintaining proper posture for extended periods, like sitting at work or standing in line.
- **Maximum distance:** The ability to complete a long hike or activity like a day at Disneyland without feeling exhausted.

### Fat Loss & Carbon Cycles (0:22:16)

- **Fat loss is primarily about carbon exchange:** You exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) through respiration, and the carbon comes from the breakdown of carbohydrates and fats in the body.
- **Calorie is a measure of energy released from breaking a carbon bond.** Thus, fat loss is about reducing carbon intake (calories in) or increasing carbon expenditure (calories out). 
- **The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) reflects the ratio of oxygen (O2) inhaled to CO2 exhaled.**  A higher RER indicates more carbohydrate utilization, while a lower RER indicates more fat utilization.
- **Increased exhalation rates are directly related to fat loss.** Any activity that increases respiration rate, like exercise, enhances carbon expenditure and can lead to fat loss.

### Exercise Intensity & Fuel Utilization (0:47:55)

- **The "crossover concept" explains how fuel utilization changes with exercise intensity:** As intensity increases, the percentage of fuel coming from carbohydrates increases, while the percentage from fat decreases.
- **Fat adapted does not mean maximizing fat burning for fat loss:** While you can enhance fat oxidation during exercise, it doesn't necessarily lead to overall fat loss.
- **Fat loss is about creating a negative carbon balance:** If you deplete carbohydrate stores through high-intensity exercise, the body will prioritize replenishing those stores with any carbohydrates you ingest, leaving fat to be used as fuel for activity.

### Muscular Endurance (2:29:40)

- **Muscular endurance is about managing acid buildup and clearing waste products.** This is a local process within the muscle, and it's not typically limited by fuel availability.
- **Capillarization is crucial for muscular endurance:**  Increased capillaries surrounding the muscle improve blood flow, allowing for better delivery of nutrients and removal of waste.
- **Training protocol:**
    - **Exercise Choice:** Choose exercises that target the specific muscle group you want to improve, such as planks, push-ups, or wall sits.
    - **Order:** Do larger muscle groups first to avoid compromising smaller muscle group performance.
    - **Sets:** Perform multiple sets of repetitions close to failure, aiming for a range of 6 to 30 repetitions.
    - **Frequency:** Train muscular endurance 2 to 4 times per week.
    - **Progression:**  Gradually increase the number of repetitions or hold time.

### Anaerobic Capacity (2:45:07)

- **Anaerobic capacity is about maximizing work output for short durations.** It's heavily influenced by acid buffering and oxygen delivery, but fuel is not typically a limiting factor.
- **Training protocol:**
    - **Exercise Choice:** Select movements you're comfortable with and safe to execute at high intensity, such as sprints, assault bike, or rowing. Avoid high eccentric loads.
    - **Sets:** Aim for 4 rounds per day, 3 times per week, with a minimum of 20 seconds of all-out effort and sufficient rest for nasal breathing recovery.
    - **Progression:** Increase the number of rounds or the duration of all-out effort.
    - **Alternative protocol:**  Perform 5 to 6 minutes of all-out work per week, distributed across 2 to 3 workouts.

### Maximum Aerobic Output (3:16:40)

- **Maximum aerobic output is about sustained high-intensity work for 5 to 15 minutes.** It's primarily limited by oxygen delivery and waste clearance.
- **Training protocol:**
    - **Exercise Choice:** Similar to anaerobic capacity, choose movements you're comfortable with and can execute safely at high intensity.
    - **Frequency:** Perform one to two high-intensity sessions per week.
    - **Progression:** Gradually increase the time or distance covered at maximum effort.
    - **Supporting work:**  Include 40% of training time in a lower intensity zone (above Zone 2 but below VO2 max) to enhance capillarization and oxygen transport.

### Long Duration Endurance (3:21:58)

- **Long duration endurance is about maintaining steady-state exercise for 20 minutes or more.** Fat utilization and intercostal muscle fatigue become more relevant at this duration.
- **Training protocol:**
    - **Exercise Choice:** Choose activities you can perform comfortably for extended periods, such as hiking, cycling, or swimming.
    - **Frequency:** Perform a minimum of one 20 to 30 minute steady-state session per week.
    - **Progression:** Gradually increase the duration of the session.
    - **Intercostal training:** Incorporate breathing drills or other exercises to strengthen the muscles around the lungs.

### Weekly Combination Training (3:29:10)

- **Combine all types of endurance training for a comprehensive approach:** Include a mix of high-intensity intervals, maximum aerobic output sessions, and long duration endurance work.
- **Sample weekly plan:**
    - **Day 1:**  High-intensity intervals (20 to 60 seconds all-out effort with sufficient rest)
    - **Day 2:** Long duration endurance (30 minutes to 1 hour)
    - **Day 3:** Maximum aerobic output (one to two 5 to 15 minute sessions) 
    - **Day 4:** Muscular endurance (planks, wall sits, push-ups, etc.)
    - **Day 5:** Strength or hypertrophy training (as per previous Huberman Lab episodes)

### Metabolic Flexibility & Longevity (3:37:23)

- **Following a balanced endurance training program promotes metabolic flexibility, enhances fat burning, and improves overall fitness.**
- **Training for endurance should be enjoyable and sustainable:**  Choose activities you enjoy and can do safely to ensure long-term adherence.
- **Endurance training can improve longevity:** Higher VO2 max is a strong predictor of lifespan.
