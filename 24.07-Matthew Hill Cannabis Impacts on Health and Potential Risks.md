## Cannabis Impacts on Health and Potential Risks

## Key Takeaways
1. THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, acts primarily on the CB1 receptor, which is widely distributed in the brain, influencing various functions like appetite, mood, and time perception.
2. THC's effects are distinct from the endogenous cannabinoids, anandamide and 2-AG, which regulate brain activity in a more specific and targeted manner.
3. While cannabis use can lead to short-term memory impairments, long-term cognitive effects are less clear and likely depend on frequency, potency, and individual factors.
4. Cannabis use disorder is a real concern, especially with frequent or high-potency use, and can manifest in ways similar to alcohol or opioid use disorder.
5. The link between cannabis use and psychosis, particularly schizophrenia, is complex and multifaceted. While cannabis can trigger psychotic episodes in individuals with schizophrenia, the evidence for cannabis directly causing the disorder is not conclusive.
6. CBD, unlike THC, does not bind to the CB1 receptor, and its mechanism of action remains unclear. While it has shown promise in treating certain forms of pediatric epilepsy, its benefits for other conditions are less well-established and may be primarily driven by the placebo effect.

### Cannabis: THC, CBD, and Terpenes (0:07:16)
- Cannabis contains various compounds called cannabinoids, with THC being the primary psychoactive component.
- THC's concentration determines the intensity of the "high."
- CBD is another cannabinoid that does not produce intoxicating effects but may influence anxiety and mood.
- Terpenes are volatile compounds found in many plants, including cannabis, contributing to its smell and flavor. They may influence psychoactive effects, but research is still limited.
- The "entourage effect" suggests that cannabinoids and terpenes work synergistically to influence the overall effects of cannabis.

### Psychoactive Effects: "High" and Time Perception (0:12:08)
- The psychoactive effects of cannabis are often described as euphoria, altered mood, changes in perception, and even a dissociative state.
- Cannabis can influence time perception, making individuals perceive time as passing more slowly.
- The mechanism behind this altered time perception is not fully understood but may involve changes in temporal ordering processes.

### Cannabis and the Brain: CB1 Receptor and Endocannabinoids (0:16:55)
- THC exerts its effects primarily through the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1), which is widely distributed in the brain.
- The CB1 receptor is not specifically designed for cannabis; its presence is likely due to biological redundancy.
- The brain produces its own cannabinoids, known as endocannabinoids, including anandamide and 2-AG.
- Endocannabinoids play a crucial role in regulating brain activity and maintaining homeostasis.
- They act in a retrograde manner, being released by post-synaptic neurons and influencing the presynaptic neuron's activity.
- This retrograde signaling helps regulate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release, ensuring proper brain function and plasticity.

### Endocannabinoids: Anandamide and 2-AG (0:26:19)
- Anandamide, named after the Sanskrit word for "bliss," was the first endocannabinoid discovered.
- It has high affinity for the CB1 receptor but low efficacy in stimulating biological responses.
- 2-AG, the second endocannabinoid, requires higher concentrations to bind to the CB1 receptor but triggers more robust intracellular signaling.
- The two endocannabinoids may have distinct roles, with anandamide potentially acting as a tonic regulator and 2-AG playing a more phasic role, being released on demand.
- The exact differences in their functions are not fully understood but likely involve their different roles in synaptic plasticity and various brain circuits.

### "Munchies" and Cannabis & Appetite (0:33:46)
- Cannabis use is often associated with increased appetite, colloquially known as the "munchies."
- THC can stimulate appetite by regulating feeding circuits in the hypothalamus, particularly the AgRP neurons.
- It also engages the reward circuitry, enhancing the rewarding aspects of food, leading to increased food-seeking behavior.
- Cannabis can override satiety signals, making individuals feel less full and more motivated to eat, even after they've consumed sufficient calories.
- This effect may involve modulation of the orbital frontal cortex, which assesses reward value and effort, as well as the suppression of leptin, a hormone that signals satiety.

### THC and Anandamide: Pharmacology and Effects (0:44:06)
- THC mimics the effects of anandamide and 2-AG but acts indiscriminately on all CB1 receptors in the brain.
- This indiscriminate activation of CB1 receptors is responsible for the intoxicating state.
- While drugs that elevate anandamide levels by inhibiting its breakdown exist, they do not produce intoxicating effects.
- This highlights the difference between THC, which acts as a direct ligand, and the endogenous cannabinoids, which operate in a more finely tuned and regulated manner.

### THC and CB1 Receptors: Intoxication and Appetite (0:52:37)
- THC's indiscriminate activation of CB1 receptors disrupts the normal balance of brain activity, resulting in the intoxicating state.
- This disruption can also affect the feeding circuits, potentially mimicking a fasting state and leading to increased appetite for calorie-dense foods.
- This effect may explain why individuals seeking out high-calorie foods when intoxicated with cannabis.

### Cannabis and Focus & Memory (0:58:57)
- Cannabis's effects on focus are less clear and require further research.
- Acute intoxication with cannabis can lead to short-term memory impairments, primarily affecting recall and consolidation.
- The evidence for long-term cognitive impairments in regular cannabis users is less robust and requires more investigation.
- State-dependent learning may contribute to the perception of improved cognitive function in chronic users, but this does not mean enhanced overall cognitive performance.

### Routes of Administration: Inhalation vs. Oral Consumption (1:04:09)
- Inhaled cannabis rapidly enters the bloodstream and brain, producing effects within minutes.
- Oral consumption of cannabis (edibles) has a slower onset, taking 30-90 minutes to produce noticeable effects.
- The time course and bioavailability of THC differ significantly between these routes of administration.
- Edibles produce lower blood levels of THC compared to inhalation, but these levels persist for longer periods.

### Self-Regulation and Cannabis Use (1:15:12)
- Individuals can self-regulate their THC intake when smoking or vaping plant matter, achieving relatively consistent blood levels.
- This self-regulation is more challenging with high-potency concentrates, which can lead to unpredictable and potentially adverse effects.
- Tolerance to cannabis is more pronounced with frequent use of high-potency extracts and concentrates.
- Chronic cannabis users may have lower CB1 receptor density, but this does not necessarily lead to a complete loss of psychoactive effects.

### Cannabis & Addiction (1:23:36)
- Cannabis use disorder is a real phenomenon and shares similarities with other substance use disorders.
- It can lead to a narrowing of pleasurable activities, disruption of daily life, and risky behaviors to obtain cannabis.
- While the conversion rate from cannabis use to cannabis use disorder is not entirely clear, it is likely higher in individuals who use cannabis weekly or more frequently.
- The perception of cannabis use disorder may vary depending on cultural norms and individual experiences.

### Cannabis Legalization: Use Patterns & ER Visits (1:31:30)
- Cannabis legalization in Canada has led to an increase in cannabis use, particularly among older adults and young adults.
- Teenage cannabis use rates have remained relatively unchanged.
- ER visits related to cannabis use, particularly due to accidental pediatric ingestion of edibles, have increased since legalization.

### Oral Consumption: Edibles and Dosing (1:36:48)
- Edibles present a greater challenge for dosing and self-regulation than inhalation due to the slower onset and prolonged effects.
- The metabolite 11-hydroxy-THC, produced from THC in the liver, can accumulate in the brain, further complicating dosing and contributing to the delayed onset of effects.

### Drug Testing & Cannabis (1:41:12)
- THC is fat-soluble and can remain detectable in the body for weeks, even after cessation of use.
- Exercise and weight loss can lead to the release of THC stored in fat, potentially causing a positive drug test result.
- The variability in THC levels and its metabolism makes accurate roadside testing challenging.
- THC blood levels are not necessarily a reliable indicator of intoxication, particularly with edibles.

### Cannabis & Hormones (1:46:04)
- The effects of cannabis on hormones, particularly testosterone and estrogen, are complex and not fully understood.
- Some studies suggest that cannabis may influence the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen, but the evidence is mixed.
- The relationship between cannabis and gynecomastia (male breast development) is not well-established and may be influenced by other factors like puberty or steroid use.
- Cannabis may also have direct effects on the testes, potentially affecting sperm quality.

### Cannabis & Pregnancy (1:54:37)
- The prevalence of cannabis use during pregnancy is estimated to be around 10%, but this can vary depending on reporting methods and awareness of pregnancy.
- Most women stop using cannabis upon learning they are pregnant.
- While some women use cannabis for morning sickness, the potential risks to the developing fetus are not fully understood and should be carefully considered.
- The use of cannabis during pregnancy is discouraged due to potential developmental effects.

### Cannabis Strains: Indica vs. Sativa (2:45:06)
- The terms "Indica" and "Sativa" are botanical classifications that do not correlate with distinct chemical profiles or subjective effects.
- Variability within each strain is often greater than the differences between them.
- Subjective reports of different effects from different strains are likely influenced by expectancy bias and the placebo effect.
- While some terpenes may influence psychoactive effects, more research is needed to understand their specific contributions.

### CBD: Biology, Effects, and Controversy (2:57:00)
- CBD does not bind to the CB1 receptor and does not produce intoxicating effects.
- It has shown clear efficacy in treating Dravet Syndrome, a severe form of pediatric epilepsy, but its benefits for other conditions are less established.
- The mechanism of CBD's action is not fully understood, but it may involve inhibiting adenosine reuptake.
- The majority of CBD products available commercially contain low doses, and the bioavailability of CBD is relatively poor, making it challenging to determine its true effects.
- The widespread use of CBD products may be driven by the placebo effect and a desire for natural health solutions.

### Cannabis Health Risks (3:19:12)
- Potential health risks associated with cannabis use include lung damage from smoking, cardiovascular issues, and cyclic vomiting syndrome.
- The evidence for cannabis causing lung cancer is less robust than for cigarette smoking.
- The effects of cannabis on cardiovascular function are complex and may involve vasodilation, tachycardia, and potentially increased vascular stiffness.
- More long-term studies are needed to fully understand the potential cardiovascular risks of cannabis use.

### Cannabis Benefits (3:31:30)
- Potential benefits of cannabis use include appetite stimulation, reduced eye pressure in glaucoma, nausea reduction, and anxiety reduction.
- Cannabis may also provide some pain relief, primarily by reducing the emotional component of pain, making it more manageable.
- The evidence for cannabis's efficacy in treating PTSD is limited but suggests it may help reduce nightmares and improve sleep quality.
- More research is needed to determine the long-term benefits of cannabis for various conditions.
