## Improve Oral Health: Its Critical Role in Brain and Body Health 

## Key Takeaways

1. **Oral health is the seventh pillar of mental, physical health and performance**, alongside sleep, sunlight, nutrition, exercise, stress management, and relationships. 
2. **Remineralization is key:**  Your teeth are constantly in a state of demineralization (demin) or remineralization (remin),  and you can actively promote remin to repair cavities and strengthen enamel. 
3. **Saliva is essential:**  Healthy saliva plays a crucial role in remineralization, fighting bacteria, and protecting your oral microbiome.
4. **Nighttime brushing and flossing are paramount:**  Your saliva production is lowest at night, making this the most important time to remove bacteria and food debris.
5. **Avoid alcohol, stimulants, smoking, vaping, excessive sugar, mouth breathing, and acidic foods/drinks:** These factors disrupt the oral microbiome and promote demineralization.

## Introduction

This episode delves into the often-overlooked importance of oral health and its profound impact on overall brain and body health.  Dr. Huberman discusses the science behind tooth and gum health, explaining how the oral microbiome influences everything from cardiovascular health to brain function. He presents practical, evidence-based protocols for maintaining optimal oral health, including dietary strategies, brushing techniques, and the use of specific tools like Xylitol.

### Oral Health & its Impact on the Body (0:00:00)

- Oral health is vital for overall well-being, not just tooth appearance and breath. 
- Oral health influences cardiovascular, metabolic, and brain health, and can even contribute to conditions like Alzheimer's disease.
- Oral health is inextricably linked to gut health due to the contiguous nature of the mouth and gut.

### Understanding Tooth and Mouth Anatomy (0:13:53)

- Teeth have layers: Enamel (outer layer), Dentin (underneath enamel), and the Pulp (innermost part). 
- Cavities form from the outside in, caused by bacteria eroding enamel and potentially reaching Dentin. 
- Demineralization (demin) and remineralization (remin) are constant processes in teeth, influenced by oral pH. 
- Gums are a critical seal: They protect the teeth, bone, and bloodstream from harmful bacteria. 
- The oral cavity is a complex ecosystem: It's vulnerable to bacteria but resilient if properly maintained, acting as a portal to the body. 

### Cavity Formation and Bacteria (0:28:51)

- Cavities are not caused by specific foods, but by bacteria that feed on sugar and produce acid. 
- **Streptococcus mutans (strep mutans):**  The primary bacteria responsible for cavities. 
- Strep mutans is communicable: It can be passed through kissing, shared utensils, etc. 
- **Acidity is the problem:**  The longer your mouth is acidic, the greater the risk of demineralization and cavity formation. 

### Remineralization: Fluoride and Natural Processes (0:35:10)

- Remineralization involves adding minerals to tooth enamel to strengthen its crystal structure.
- **Hydroxyapatite:** The primary mineral responsible for remineralization.
- **Fluoride:** A substance that can strengthen enamel bonds, but has potential downsides for thyroid and brain health. 
- **Controversy around fluoride:**  There's a growing debate about its safety, with some advocating for its removal from drinking water. 
- **Hydroxyapatite in toothpaste:** An alternative to fluoride that supports natural remineralization.

### Oral Health "Do Nots":  Practices to Avoid (0:43:58)

- **Alcohol:** Disrupts oral microbiome, increases acidity, and harms mucosal lining cells.
- **Stimulants (Adderall, Ritalin, etc.):**  Increase acidity, encourage mouth breathing, and disrupt the oral microbiome.
- **Smoking and Vaping:**  Damage gums, contribute to cancer risk, and disrupt the oral microbiome.
- **Sugar:** Provides fuel for bacteria that produce acid. 
- **Mouth Breathing:**  Dries out the mouth, increasing acidity and promoting bacteria growth. 
- **Acidic Foods/Drinks:**  Lemons, carbonated beverages, etc., should be consumed in moderation and rinsed away.

###  Tools for Remineralization: Fasting, Nighttime Brushing (0:54:48)

- **Intermittent fasting:**  Creating windows of time without eating (especially during the day) can promote healthy saliva production and remineralization.
- **Nighttime brushing and flossing:**  Critical for removing bacteria and food debris while saliva production is low. 
- **Xylitol:**  An artificial sweetener that bacteria consume but cannot use to produce acid. It also kills strep mutans.

### Brushing, Flossing, and Tooth Sensitivity (1:03:23)

- **Soft toothbrush:** Recommended for gentle biofilm removal and gum health. 
- **Electric toothbrush:**  Use with light pressure, focusing on gum stimulation.
- **Gum brushing:**  Can improve blood flow to teeth and reduce sensitivity.
- **Flossing:**  Essential for removing food debris from between teeth. 
- **Waterpik:**  An alternative to traditional flossing, considered gentler on gums.

### Understanding Plaque, Tartar, and Tooth Polishing (1:11:02)

- **Biofilm:** A layer of bacteria that attaches to teeth.
- **Plaque:** A thicker layer of bacteria, more dense than biofilm. 
- **Tartar:** Hardened plaque that requires professional cleaning. 
- **Tooth polishing:**  Smoothes tooth surfaces to make it harder for bacteria to adhere.

###  Mouthwash:  The Dangers of Alcohol-Based Options (1:22:38)

- **Alcohol-based mouthwashes:**  Harmful to oral microbiome and mucosal lining.
- **Antiseptic mouthwashes:**  May be prescribed for bacterial infections, but can have negative effects on overall health. 
- **Non-alcohol, non-antiseptic mouthwashes:**  A safer alternative for breath freshening.

### Low-Cost Oral Health Solutions: Baking Soda, Salt Water Rinse (1:26:29)

- **Baking soda:**  A natural abrasive for cleaning teeth. 
- **Hydrogen peroxide:**  Not recommended for oral rinses due to its abrasiveness.
- **Salt water rinse:**  Promotes healthy oral bacteria and can be used as a natural mouthwash.

### Nitric Oxide: The Importance of Oral Health (1:32:36)

- **Nitric oxide:**  A vital molecule for vasodilation and overall health. 
- **Alcohol-based mouthwashes:**  Can reduce nitric oxide production. 

### Canker Sore Prevention and Gut Microbiome (1:34:52)

- **Healthy gut microbiome:**  Can promote oral health and reduce canker sore formation.
- **Low-sugar fermented foods:**  A key component of a healthy gut microbiome.
- **Sleep:**  Essential for gut and oral microbiome health.

###  Tongue Brushing and Toothbrush Care (1:37:47)

- **Tongue brushing:**  Recommended for removing bacteria buildup.
- **Separate toothbrush for tongue:**  Helps to prevent bacteria crossover.
- **Toothbrush care:**  Bacteria proliferate on toothbrushes, so it's important to rinse and dry them thoroughly. 

### Sealants, Fillings, Mercury, and Root Canals (1:41:38)

- **Sealants:**  Protective coatings for teeth, generally considered safe.
- **Metal fillings:**  May contain mercury, which can be released if disturbed.
- **Mastic gum:**  Chewing this gum can disrupt metal fillings and release mercury.
- **Root canals:**  Sometimes necessary for deep cavities or tooth damage, but daily oral health practices can help prevent the need for them.

### Dentist Visits: The Importance of Routine Checkups (1:48:43)

- **Routine dental cleanings:**  Remove tartar and identify cavities, but they don't promote remineralization. 
- **Dental checkups:**  Important for evaluating oral health and identifying potential issues.
- **Frequency of visits:**  May vary based on individual oral health, diligence with home care, and genetic factors.

###  Other Practices for Optimal Oral Health (1:54:17)

- **Oil pulling:**  Swishing oil in the mouth, although some dentists see potential benefits, requires more research.
- **Vitamin D:**  Adequate levels can support tooth health.
- **Dietary fiber:**  Essential for gut microbiome health.
- **Consistency is key:**  Maintaining a daily oral health routine is crucial for long-term success.
