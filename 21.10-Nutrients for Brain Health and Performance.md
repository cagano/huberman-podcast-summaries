## Nutrients for Brain Health and Performance

## Key Takeaways

1. **Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) & Phospholipids:** Omega-3s (especially EPA) are crucial for neuron health and function. Aim for at least 1.5 grams of EPA per day through fish, chia seeds, walnuts, or supplementation.
2. **Phosphatidylserine:** Supports neuronal function, improves cognition, and may reduce cognitive decline. Found in meat, fish, and cabbage. 300 mg daily supplement can be beneficial.
3. **Choline:**  Essential for acetylcholine production, which is vital for focus and alertness. Rich sources include egg yolks, potatoes, nuts, seeds, grains, and fruits. Aim for 500 mg to 1 gram per day.
4. **Hydration & Electrolytes:** Crucial for neuronal function. Ensure adequate water intake and sufficient sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
5. **Creatine:** Enhances brain function, particularly in those not consuming meat. 5 grams of creatine monohydrate daily can improve cognition.
6. **Anthocyanins (from Dark Berries):** Found in blueberries, blackberries, and dark currants. May reduce DNA damage, improve cognitive function, and offset cognitive decline. Aim for 10 mg/day from extract or 1-2 cups of berries.
7. **L-Glutamine:**  Supports immune function and may offset sugar cravings. Found in cottage cheese, beef, chicken, fish, dairy, eggs, and vegetables. 1-10 grams daily can be beneficial. 
8. **Fermented Foods:**  Promote a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for food preference signaling. Aim for 2-4 servings daily of low-sugar fermented foods like natto and sauerkraut.
9. **Belief and Food Preferences:**  Our thoughts and beliefs about food can influence how we experience its taste and how our bodies utilize its nutrients. 
10. **Pairing for Rewiring:** Pair foods that are good for your brain with those that increase brain metabolism (e.g., glucose or ketones) to enhance their desirability and make them more enjoyable.

## Introduction

This episode dives into the fascinating world of food and its impact on brain health and performance. Professor Huberman discusses key nutrients that support brain function and longevity, explores the mechanisms behind food preferences, and shares practical advice for rewiring our cravings to favor healthier choices.

### Essential Fatty Acids and Phospholipids (0:13:00)

- **EFAs are crucial for neuron structure and function:**  Neuron membranes are composed primarily of fats, particularly EFAs and phospholipids.
- **Omega-3s are essential:** Most people don't get enough omega-3s (especially EPA) in their diet. 
- **Benefits of EPA:**  May offset depression, enhance mood, and improve cognitive function.
- **Food sources of EPA:** Fatty fish (mackerel, salmon, herring, sardines, anchovies), chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans.
- **Supplementation:**  Consider supplementing with fish oil, krill oil, or algae-based EPA to reach 1.5-3 grams per day.

### Phosphatidylserine (0:20:35)

- **Supports neuronal function and cognition:**  Studies show phosphatidylserine supplementation (300 mg daily) may improve cognition and reduce cognitive decline.
- **Food sources:**  Meat, fish, and cabbage.
- **Supplementation:**  Consider supplementing with phosphatidylserine if you don't consume sufficient amounts from food.

### Choline (0:22:15)

- **Essential for acetylcholine production:**  Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator vital for focus, alertness, and memory.
- **Primary food source:**  Egg yolks.
- **Other sources:** Potatoes, nuts, seeds, grains, and fruits.
- **Supplementation:**  Consider supplementing with alpha-GPC (300 mg 2-4 times per week) to enhance choline function.

### Hydration & Electrolytes (0:28:26)

- **Crucial for neuronal function:** Adequate water intake and sufficient sodium, magnesium, and potassium are vital for nerve cell activity.
- **Importance of hydration:**  The brain is largely composed of water.
- **Electrolyte function:**  Sodium, potassium, and magnesium are essential for nerve impulse transmission.

### Creatine (0:32:22)

- **Enhances brain function:** Creatine can be used as a fuel source in the brain and may improve cognitive function, particularly in those who don't consume meat.
- **Food sources:** Meat.
- **Supplementation:**  Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (5 grams daily) for cognitive benefits.

### Anthocyanins (0:36:28)

- **Found in dark berries:**  Blueberries, blackberries, and dark currants are rich in anthocyanins.
- **Benefits:**  May reduce DNA damage, improve cognitive function, and offset cognitive decline.
- **Supplementation:**  Consider supplementing with blueberry extract (5.5-11 grams daily).
- **Food sources:**  1-2 cups of fresh berries daily.

### L-Glutamine (0:41:19)

- **Supports immune function:**  May enhance immune system function.
- **May offset sugar cravings:**  Glutamine-sensing neurons in the gut signal satiation to the brain.
- **Food sources:**  Cottage cheese, beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, beans, cabbage, spinach, and parsley.
- **Supplementation:**  Consider supplementing with glutamine (1-10 grams daily).

### Fermented Foods (0:59:50)

- **Promote a healthy gut microbiome:**  Fermented foods like natto and sauerkraut can improve the composition of the gut microbiota, which in turn affects food preference signaling. 
- **Recommended intake:** 2-4 servings daily.

### Practical Advice and Strategies

#### Brain-Boosting Foods (0:09:22)

- **EFAs (Omega-3s):**  Include fatty fish, chia seeds, walnuts, or supplement with EPA.
- **Phosphatidylserine:**  Increase meat and fish intake or consider supplementation.
- **Choline:**  Eat egg yolks, potatoes, nuts, seeds, grains, or supplement with alpha-GPC.
- **Creatine:**  Consume meat or supplement with creatine monohydrate.
- **Anthocyanins:**  Eat dark berries like blueberries, blackberries, and currants.

####  Food Preference Rewiring (0:49:23)

- **Pair healthy foods with those that increase brain metabolism:**  To increase the desirability of brain-healthy foods, pair them with foods that elevate glucose or ketones.
- **Beliefs matter:**  What you believe about a food can affect how it tastes and how your body utilizes it.
- **Utilize the insula:**  Engage your insula (the part of the brain that interprets internal states) to shape your food choices.

#### Artificial Sweeteners (1:13:25)

- **Avoid pairing with glucose-elevating foods:**  Consuming artificial sweeteners in combination with foods that increase blood glucose can disrupt insulin management and potentially lead to insulin resistance.
