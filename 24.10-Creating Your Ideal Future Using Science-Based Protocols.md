#### Creating Your Ideal Future Using Science-Based Protocols

## Key Takeaways
1.  **Transgenerational Empathy:** Cultivate empathy for yourself, past generations, and future generations to foster long-term thinking.
2.  **Presentism vs. Futures Thinking:**  Combat the overwhelming present-day stimuli by consciously shifting focus to long-term goals and planning.
3.  **Emotion as a Guiding Force:** Utilize emotions, not just intellect, to drive action towards desired future states, leveraging the amygdala's connection to action planning.
4.  **Cathedral Thinking:** Engage in actions whose benefits you may not personally experience, contributing to a legacy beyond your lifespan.
5.  **Modeling Behavior:**  Your actions serve as a powerful model for future generations, emphasizing the importance of daily interactions and mindful choices.
6.  **Protopia:** Shift focus from dystopian narratives to visualizing and building "protopias"—better, though not perfect, futures.
7.  **Time Capsules:** Actively create personal time capsules (photo frames, letters to future self) to solidify long-term goals and leave a positive impact.

## Introduction
This episode features Andrew Huberman in conversation with Ari Wallach, an expert in long-term thinking and coordinated behavior. They discuss how to navigate the challenges of presentism (over-focus on the immediate present) and cultivate a future-oriented mindset for personal well-being and societal progress.

### Mental Time Travel; Technology & Present [0:06:13]
-   Homo sapiens excel at mental time travel (past, present, future).
-   The hippocampus plays a crucial role in assembling past memories to project future scenarios.
-   Modern technology and constant notifications have significantly shortened our cognitive time horizons, leading to "presentism."

### Technology; Tools [0:15:46]
-   Transgenerational empathy involves self-compassion, empathy for past generations, and empathy for future generations.
-   Empathy for self involves recognizing limitations and striving for improvement without self-criticism.
-   Focus on daily improvements ("What can I do today to make my life and the lives of others better?") rather than solely comparing to past performance.

### Tool: Empathy for Others [0:22:00]
-   Empathy involves both cognitive understanding and emotional connection.
-   Requires presence, suppression of distractions, and a return to self-attention.
-   Despite challenges, humans are better off today (health, longevity, etc.) but face new inflection points (climate change, AI).

### Empathy for Future Generations, Emotion & Logic [0:26:09]
-   To effectively build empathy for future generations, cultivate emotional connections, not just intellectual understanding.
-   The amygdala's role in associating emotions with actions is crucial.
-   Emotions guide future actions; negative emotions indicate behaviors to avoid, while pro-social emotions encourage beneficial actions.

### Tool: Perfect Day Exercise; Cathedral Thinking, Awe & Future Generations [0:38:02]
-   The "perfect day" exercise (imagining ideal scenarios and associated sensations) helps identify potential action steps.
-   "Cathedral thinking" involves working on projects whose benefits extend far beyond one's lifetime.
-   Awe inspires action; experiencing awe related to long-term projects fosters emotional connection to future generations.

### Egoic Legacy, Modeling Behavior [0:43:52]
-   Egoic legacy (seeking recognition) is less impactful than modeling positive behaviors for future generations.
-   Focus on actions rather than recognition; your behavior shapes the actions of those around you.
-   Short-term contingencies are important but need to be balanced with longer-term goals.

### Social Media, Time Capsule, Storytelling [0:51:13]
-   Social media's short-term reward cycles hinder long-term thinking.
-   Storytelling is a fundamental tool for cultural transmission and should be used for building positive future narratives.
-   Traditional media (literature, art, music) serves as long-term time capsules of human experience.

### Short-Term Thinking; Life Purpose, Science & Religion [1:01:18]
-   Modern technology often shortens our time horizons and reinforces short-term thinking.
-   Science can explain how we got here but not necessarily where we're going.
-   Long-term thinking needs a sense of Telos (ultimate purpose), which often used to be provided by religion.

### Longpath, Telos, Time Perception [1:09:23]
-   Longpath philosophy centers on transgenerational empathy, futures thinking, and Telos (ultimate aim).
-   We often suffer from "lifespan bias," focusing solely on our individual lifespans rather than the broader generational timeline.
-   Identifying and understanding our Telos (purpose) is crucial for long-term thinking.

### Tools: Photo Frames; Behavior & Legacy; Life in Weeks [1:15:19]
-   Visual aids (photo frames with aged images of self, life-in-weeks charts) can help connect to a future self and make better decisions.
-   The actions and behaviors we model have a lasting impact on future generations.
-   Visualizing future self (aged self) encourages better self-care and long-term planning.

### Death, Western Society [1:30:17]
-   The fear of death is a powerful motivator driving short-term behaviors.
-   Western society's aversion to death hinders long-term thinking.
-   Reconciling with mortality is crucial for embracing a future-oriented mindset.

### Tool: Writing Letter to Future Self [1:36:20]
-   Writing letters to your future self is a powerful tool for connecting with your future aspirations and planning for it.
-   The act of writing the letter prompts introspection and clarifies long-term goals.
-   Life is a relay race; we pass the baton of knowledge, values, and experiences to future generations.


### Society, Future Harmony [1:41:01]
-   Societal progress requires a collective shift towards future consciousness.
-   We need to move away from dystopian narratives and embrace "protopia"—a better tomorrow, not a perfect one.
-   Critical examination of inherited cultural stories is essential to build a more fulfilling future.

### Traditional Institutions, Family, Future Consciousness; “Protopia” [1:47:03]
-   Fracturing of traditional institutions (religion, family, higher education) contributes to short-term thinking.
-   Reconsidering family structures and rediscovering the value of intergenerational connection is crucial.
-   We need narratives that focus on protopia (a better future, not a perfect one) to foster hope and motivate action.

### Tool: Behavior & Modeling for the Future [1:58:48]
-   Even small actions model positive behavior for others.
-   Social emotional contagion spreads long-term thinking and actions.
-   Our actions today shape the world of future AI and generations to come.
