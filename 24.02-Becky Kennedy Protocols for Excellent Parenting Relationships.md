## Becky Kennedy: Protocols for Excellent Parenting Relationships

## Key Takeaways
1. **Sturdy Parenting:**  A combination of setting boundaries and empathy. Boundaries are what we tell others we will do, requiring no action from the other person. Empathy involves seeing someone else's feelings and experience as real.
2. **Family Jobs:** Parents have two jobs: setting boundaries and empathizing/validating. These jobs keep kids safe and help them learn emotion regulation. 
3. **Confidence Building:**  Say "I believe you" to your child. This conveys that their experiences are real and valid, building self-trust and confidence.
4. **Repair & Apologies:** Repairing after a conflict involves separating your identity from your behavior and showing up differently. A genuine apology focuses on taking responsibility for your actions ("I'm sorry I yelled").
5. **Generous Interpretation:** When kids say things like "I hate you," it's often a sign of intense hurt and disappointment, not malicious intent.  
6. **Deeply Feeling Kids:**  Kids who experience emotions more intensely need a sturdy leader who can set boundaries while also providing validation and connection.
7. **Parent Relationship & Conflict:**  It's crucial to maintain your own relationships and take care of your needs as a parent. Witnessing conflict can be just as impactful on children as the conflict itself.

### Sturdy Relationships & the Parent Job (0:07:35)
- **Sturdiness:**  The ability to be connected to yourself and another person simultaneously.
- **Two Parent Jobs:** 
    - **Boundaries:**  Communicating what you will do, regardless of the other person's response.
    - **Empathy & Validation:** Seeing and acknowledging another person's feelings as real, even if you don't agree with them. 

### Boundaries and Requests (0:14:34)
- **Boundaries vs. Requests:**  Many parents mistake requests for boundaries. A request requires the other person to comply; a boundary is a statement of what you will do.
- **Clear Examples:** 
    - **TV Time:**  Instead of asking your child to turn off the TV, state that you will turn it off yourself if they don't comply.
    - **Intrusive Mother-in-Law:** If your mother-in-law consistently arrives unannounced, tell her you will not let her in the next time it happens.

###  Craving Connection, Not Just Rules (0:18:24)
- **Connection:** Kids crave boundaries because they want to feel safe and secure. 
- **Validation:** Validation is crucial for helping kids learn to regulate their emotions. It involves acknowledging their feelings without condoning their behavior.

### Rewards & Punishments: Shifting the Paradigm (0:22:19)
- **Inherent Goodness:**  Dr. Kennedy believes kids are inherently good but lack the skills to manage their emotions. Punishing behavior focuses on the external action, not the underlying cause.
- **Building Skills:**  Instead of rewarding or punishing, focus on helping kids develop the skills they need to manage their emotions and participate in family life.
- **Purposeful Contributions:**  Kids naturally want to feel like a meaningful part of the family and contribute to the household.

###  Kids Are Inherently Good (0:31:16)
- **Control vs. Trust:**  A system of rewards and punishments implies a lack of trust in a child's inherent goodness.
- **Reflection:** We shape our children's identities through our reflections of them. Constant punishment can lead to a sense of unlovability and badness.

### Impingement & Family Jobs (0:34:06)
- **Impingement:**  Setting boundaries and making decisions for children when necessary.
- **Family Jobs Framework:**  The parent sets boundaries, and the child feels their feelings.  
- **"I Believe You":**  A powerful phrase that validates a child's experience and helps them build self-trust.

### The Power of "I Believe You" (0:44:48)
- **"I Believe You" vs. "I Hear You":**  "I believe you" acknowledges the reality of someone's experience, even if you don't agree with it. "I hear you" implies listening but doesn't necessarily convey belief.
- **Building Confidence:** Saying "I believe you" helps kids trust their own feelings and experience the world with confidence.

### Trauma & Aloneness (0:52:15)
- **Trauma:**  Not the event itself, but the way it is processed internally. Events processed in aloneness are more likely to become traumatic.
- **Repair:**  Repairing after conflict is essential for preventing trauma. It involves acknowledging your role in the conflict and taking responsibility.

###  Good Apologies (0:57:07)
- **Self-Repair:**  Before apologizing to your child, repair with yourself by acknowledging your behavior without letting it define your identity.
- **"I'm Sorry I Yelled":**  A simple, powerful apology that acknowledges your actions and takes responsibility. 
- **Avoiding "Buts":**  Phrases like "I'm sorry you felt that way, but..." are not genuine apologies.

###  Rudeness & Disrespect (1:04:37)
- **Most Generous Interpretation:**  When kids are rude, try to understand the underlying feelings and emotions.  
- **"I Hate You":** Often a manifestation of intense hurt and disappointment.
- **No Response:** Sometimes the best response to rudeness is doing nothing. It allows the child to re-evaluate their behavior and recognize the impact of their words.

###  Walking on Eggshells & Sturdy Leadership (1:12:32)
- **Fear of Kids:**  Parents who are afraid of their kids' reactions may be walking on eggshells. This can create a dynamic where children hold emotional power.
- **Deeply Feeling Kids:**  Kids who experience emotions intensely may have bigger outbursts but are also more capable of deep love and empathy.
- **"I Am Not Scared of Your Feelings":**  A crucial phrase for parents of deeply feeling kids, reassuring them that their feelings will be contained.

### Deeply Feeling Kids, Love & Joy (1:20:49)
- **Sensory Overload:**  Deeply feeling kids are often hypersensitives to the environment, experiencing sensory overload.
- **Deep Love:**  These kids may have a strong fear of abandonment but are also deeply loving and capable of great empathy.

### Co-Parenting Differences & Punishment (1:30:10)
- **Align Strategies:**  Try to have open communication with co-parents and agree on parenting strategies as much as possible.
- **Center the Child:**  When there are differences in parenting approaches, focus on helping the child understand their experience rather than focusing on the other parent's actions.

###  ADHD & Self-Regulation (1:37:11)
- **Channel Not a Dam:**  Allow kids to express their energy in healthy ways. Encourage physical activity and other outlets for emotional catharsis. 
- **Meditation:**  Meditation and other tools for self-regulation can be helpful for all kids, including those with ADHD.

###  Tolerating Frustration & Screen Time (1:41:20)
- **Cost of Boundaries:**  The cost of parents not being able to set boundaries has never been higher. 
- **Gratification & Frustration:**  Children are increasingly exposed to immediate gratification, which can make it challenging for them to tolerate frustration.
- **Learning Space:**  The space between not knowing something and successfully doing it is where learning happens. Encourage kids to lean into that space and experience frustration. 

### Entitlement & Fear of Frustration (2:34:26)
- **Entitlement:**  The fear of frustration. When kids are consistently shielded from frustration, they develop an intolerance for it.
- **Dosing Frustration:**  Purposefully exposing kids to frustration in small doses can help them build resilience and develop a healthy sense of entitlement.

### Experiencing Frustration: Chores & Allowance (2:41:57)
- **Gratitude:**  Experiencing frustration and doing chores can help kids develop a sense of gratitude.
- **Purposeful Actions:**  Chores help kids contribute to the family and understand that life sometimes involves doing boring or unpleasant things.

### Good Inside Platform & Actionable Resources (2:46:31)
- **Good Inside Membership:**  A platform that provides parents with actionable resources, scripts, and support for navigating parenting challenges.
- **Dualingo for Parenting:**  Dr. Kennedy aims to provide parents with the tools they need to learn a new language of parenting, based on empathy, boundaries, and connection.

###  Relationship to Self (1:51:57)
- **Self-Validation:**  Applying the concepts of boundaries and empathy to our relationship with ourselves. 
- **"I'm Noticing":**  A powerful phrase for helping kids process their emotions and understand the patterns in their experience.

### Emotional Regulation & Asking Questions (1:55:24)
- **Nuanced Emotions:**  Help kids explore the full range of emotions and understand that there is more nuance than just "good" and "bad."
- **"I Wonder":** A less controlling way to engage with children and open up a space for reflection.

### Adolescence & Critical Needs (2:01:15)
- **Separation & Identity Formation:**  Adolescence is a time of separation and identity formation. Teens need space to explore who they are.
- **Explorers vs. Nomads:**  Teens need to feel like explorers, venturing out and trying new things, but they also need a home base to return to.

###  Saying "I Love You" (2:09:58)
- **Power of "I Love You":**  Reminding children that you love them unconditionally, even when they are behaving badly, is crucial.

### Family Meetings: A Potentially Useful Tool (2:15:07)
- **Teamwork:**  Approach family meetings as a team working together to solve problems.
- **Positive Outcomes:**  Frame conversations with a hopeful outlook and emphasize that you believe in your child's ability to make positive change. 

###  Self-Care & Rage (2:15:07)
- **Prioritizing Needs:**  It's crucial for parents to prioritize their own needs and maintain their own relationships. 
- **Rage:**  Rage in parents can often be a sign that their own needs are not being met.
- **Two Sturdy Leaders:**  Having two sturdy leaders in a child's life can be beneficial, but it's not about perfection. 

### Parent Relationship & Conflict (2:22:08)
- **Modeling Relationships:**  Children learn about adult relationships from observing their parents. 
- **Talking About Conflict:**  It's important to talk to children about conflicts and acknowledge the impact they have on them. 

### Wayward Teens & Substance Use (2:22:08)
- **Indicators of Trouble:**  Signs that a teen may need additional help include a decline in overall functioning, a shrinking world, and increased conflict in the home. 
- **Seeking Help:**  Seeking help is a sign of strength and love.

###  Mentors (2:30:03)
- **External Sources of Support:**  Mentors can provide children with the healthy examples and guidance that their parents may not be able to offer.
