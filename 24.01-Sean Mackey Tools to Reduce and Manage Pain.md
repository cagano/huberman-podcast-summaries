## Sean Mackey: Tools to Reduce and Manage Pain

## Key Takeaways
1. **Pain is subjective and multifaceted**: It involves sensory and emotional components, influenced by individual experiences, beliefs, and context.
2. **Pain pathways are complex**: There's no single "pain center" in the brain, but rather a distributed network of regions.
3. **Hurt vs. Harm**: Distinguishing between experiencing pain ("hurt") and underlying tissue damage ("harm") is crucial for effective pain management.
4. **Pain can be modulated**: Through physical interventions like heat/cold, touch, and exercise; psychological approaches like distraction and mindfulness; and medications like NSAIDs and opioids.
5. **Opioids are complex**: While opioids can be effective for pain management in some cases, they also have a high addictive potential and have been overprescribed, leading to the opioid crisis.

### What is Pain? (0:06:13)
- Pain is a complex, subjective experience that serves a protective role, alerting us to potential harm.
- It involves both sensory and emotional components, making it highly individual.
- Chronic pain, which affects millions of Americans, represents a significant societal burden.

### Understanding Pain Pathways (0:13:05)
- Pain signals originate from nociceptors, sensory receptors in the body that detect various stimuli (temperature, pressure, inflammation).
- These signals travel through nerve fibers (A-delta and C fibers) to the spinal cord and ultimately the brain.
- The brain interprets these signals, factoring in emotional, cognitive, and memory influences, to create the subjective experience of pain.

### Treating Pain: NSAIDs & Analgesics (0:16:15)
- NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, and Tylenol are not technically painkillers, but anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic agents.
- They reduce sensitization and inflammation in the periphery and spinal cord, but not pain directly.
- Optimal dosage and timing are crucial, with consideration for potential side effects and interactions.
- Aspirin has a different mechanism of action and can be beneficial for heart health at low doses.

### Inflammation, Pain & Recovery (0:22:46)
- Prostaglandins are a key factor in inflammation, sensitizing the area and increasing pain.
- While inflammation serves a protective role, NSAIDs can sometimes interfere with the healing process.
- Balancing pain relief with promoting healing is essential, with the goal of restoring normal functioning.
- Individual variability in response to NSAIDs necessitates personalized approach and rotating medications to find the most effective ones.

### Pain & Touch: The Gate Control Theory (0:32:34)
- The gate control theory explains how touch can modulate pain through activation of specific nerve fibers (A-beta fibers).
- Rubbing, shaking, or running water over an injured area can activate these fibers, inhibiting pain signals in the spinal cord.
- Kissing an injured area also likely activates touch fibers and elicits positive emotional responses, further reducing pain.
- The TENS device (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) leverages this principle by delivering electrical impulses to stimulate touch fibers.

### Pain Thresholds and Individual Variability (0:38:56)
- Pain threshold refers to the intensity of a stimulus needed to elicit the first perception of pain.
- Men generally have higher pain thresholds for heat stimuli than women, though there's considerable overlap between the groups.
- Individual variability within each group is significant, emphasizing the importance of personalized approaches to pain management.
- Factors influencing pain thresholds include stress, anxiety, beliefs, expectations, and past experiences.

### Pain Modulation: Pain Inhibits Pain (0:44:53)
- Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) refers to the phenomenon where pain in one area can inhibit pain in another.
- This involves activation of brain stem circuits that send descending pathways to the spinal cord, reducing pain signals.
- The "stomp on your foot" anecdote illustrates this concept, suggesting that pain can be modulated by applying a painful stimulus to a different area.
- CPM may be less effective in certain chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia.

### Heat, Cold & Pain:  Changing Pain Threshold (0:53:20)
- Cold reduces inflammation and slows nerve firing, providing temporary pain relief.
- Heat increases blood flow, relaxes muscles, and can be soothing, but it may also increase inflammation.
- Using heat or cold depends on individual preference and the specific pain condition.
- Deliberate cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths, may increase pain tolerance over time.

###  Psychology & Pain: Distraction vs. Acceptance (1:00:54)
- Two main cognitive strategies for managing pain are attentional distraction and meeting the pain.
- Distraction, through activities like reading, walking, or socializing, engages specific brain networks to shift focus away from pain.
- Meeting the pain involves non-judgmental acceptance and reframing its meaning.
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) incorporate these approaches to manage pain and associated negative emotions.
- Distinguishing between "being hurt" and "being harmed" is crucial for cognitive reframing and effective coping.

### Emotional Pain & Its Relationship to Physical Pain (1:12:38)
- Emotional pain, like psychological hurt or injury, is real and can manifest as physical symptoms.
- It's essential to address both physical and emotional pain holistically, recognizing their interconnectedness.
- Anger, a common emotion in pain, can exacerbate pain and negatively impact coping.
- Anger can be expressed outwardly (anger out) or internally (anger in), both of which are associated with negative outcomes.

### Nutrition & Pain: Identifying Food Triggers (1:20:43)
- Nutrition plays a critical role in pain management, and identifying food triggers is essential.
- Elimination diets, where foods are systematically reintroduced, can help pinpoint trigger foods.
- Dr. Mackey shares his personal experience with developing sensitivity to onions following a gut infection, highlighting the importance of personalized dietary approaches.
- Further research is needed to understand how specific foods impact pain pathways and the microbiome.

### Visceral Pain: Deep Pain & Referred Pain (1:28:45)
- Visceral pain, arising from internal organs, often feels diffuse and less well-localized compared to somatic pain.
- The receptive fields for visceral nociceptors are broader, leading to pain radiating over a larger area.
- Viscerosomatic convergence, where visceral fibers converge with somatic fibers in the spinal cord, can explain referred pain, where pain is perceived in a different location from the source.
- Examples include heart attacks causing arm pain and pelvic pain referred to the lower back.

### Neuropathic Pain & The Role of Nerve Damage (1:34:02)
- Neuropathic pain arises from damage to nerves in the peripheral or central nervous system.
- It often presents with distinct qualities like shooting, stabbing, or burning pain.
- Neuropathic pain can be challenging to treat due to the underlying nerve damage.
- Disc bulges, while often asymptomatic, can cause referred pain in the extremities due to nerve branching.

### Stress, Memory & Psychological Pain (1:40:23)
- Chronic stress can contribute to pain by activating the sympathetic nervous system and increasing cortisol levels.
- Early life experiences, particularly adverse events, can influence pain perception and emotional processing in adulthood.
- Pain memory can be triggered by stress or other stimuli, leading to a resurgence of pain even in the absence of current injury.

### Romantic Love & Pain: The Analgesic Effects of Love (1:46:57)
- Dr. Mackey describes a study that found love can act as an analgesic, reducing pain perception.
- Viewing a picture of a loved one activated brain reward circuits, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, all of which are associated with pleasure and pain modulation.
- The strength of the relationship, measured by preoccupation with the partner, correlated with the pain-reducing effects.
- These findings suggest a link between love, addiction, and pain modulation, potentially influencing relationship stability.

### Endogenous & Exogenous Opioids (1:48:57)
- The body naturally produces endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalins) that act as painkillers.
- Exogenous opioids, derived from plants like poppies (e.g., morphine) or synthesized (e.g., oxycodone), have been used for pain management.
- The opioid crisis highlights the potent addictive potential of exogenous opioids and the need for cautious use.
- Opioids have been overprescribed, leading to misuse and dependence in many cases.

### Opioid Crisis & Prescribing Practices (1:53:17)
- The opioid crisis is driven by both overprescribing and illicit fentanyl production.
- Overprescribing, fueled by inadequate pain management training and marketing efforts, has contributed to the crisis.
- Fear of legal consequences has led some physicians to abandon patients, further contributing to the opioid crisis.
- It's crucial to distinguish between physicians doing the right thing for the wrong reasons (overprescribing due to lack of knowledge) and those doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons (pill mills).

### Opioids & Fentanyl (2:02:21)
- Fentanyl, a potent opioid, is primarily responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.
- It is produced illicitly and trafficked across borders, contributing to the epidemic.
-  The focus on fentanyl shouldn't overshadow the need for effective pain management.
- Compassionate deprescribing and alternative pain management strategies are needed to reduce opioid dependence.

### Kratom & Cannabis (2:07:44)
- Kratom, a plant-based substance with opioid-like properties, is available over the counter in the US.
-  It's used by some to manage pain and reduce opioid dependence.
- Research is needed to understand its mechanisms, safety, and efficacy.
- Cannabis, including both THC and CBD, has shown promise in reducing neuropathic pain in controlled settings.
- The US government's categorization of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug hinders research and limits understanding of its potential benefits.

### Pain Management Therapies: A Holistic Approach (2:18:12)
- A comprehensive pain management approach involves various therapies, including medications, nerve blocks, psychology, physical therapy, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and self-empowerment.
- Acupuncture, despite its long history, remains a topic of scientific investigation.
- Its mechanisms are not fully understood, but it may activate peripheral adenosine receptors and engage different brain regions.
- Finding reliable practitioners, whether physicians or acupuncturists, is crucial for optimal care.

### Physical Therapy, Chronic Pain & Pacing (2:31:35)
- Physical therapists play a vital role in pain management by promoting physical activity, rehabilitating function, and teaching coping strategies.
- Pacing, a key concept in chronic pain management, involves setting small, achievable goals and avoiding overexertion.
- This helps prevent pain flare-ups and promotes gradual improvement in activity levels.
- Collaboration between physicians, physical therapists, and pain psychologists is essential for optimal pain management.

### Supplements & Pain (2:36:35)
-  Several over-the-counter supplements have shown benefits for pain management, including acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin C, fish oil, and creatine.
- These supplements have various mechanisms of action and can be beneficial for neuropathic pain and other conditions.
- It's essential to be aware of potential side effects, interactions, and appropriate dosages before using any supplements.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy & Biofeedback (2:42:25)
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a valuable tool for managing pain by identifying and challenging negative thoughts and behaviors.
- Techniques like relaxation techniques, deep breathing, and biofeedback can help regulate the sympathetic nervous system and reduce pain.
- Biofeedback allows for real-time monitoring of physiological responses, facilitating self-regulation and pain reduction.
- Brief interventions, like Beth Darnell's "Empowered Relief," offer a condensed approach to CBT, making it more accessible.

### The National Pain Strategy & Public Action (2:48:32)
- The National Pain Strategy, a comprehensive plan for addressing the pain epidemic in the US, was developed in 2019.
- It emphasizes a holistic approach to pain management, focusing on education, research, and public awareness.
- Full implementation of this strategy is crucial for improving pain care in the US.
-  Concerned citizens can take action by contacting their elected officials, advocating for the strategy's implementation, and supporting organizations like Pain USA.
