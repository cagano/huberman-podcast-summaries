## Leveraging Ultradian Cycles, Protecting Your Brain, Seed Oils Examined, and More

## Key Takeaways
1. **Ultradian Cycles:** These 90-minute cycles, occurring throughout the day and night, influence alertness, focus, and neuroplasticity.
2. **Optimal Learning Times:** Two periods of peak alertness, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, offer ideal opportunities for focused learning.
3. **Triggering Neuroplasticity:**  A 60-minute window within each ultradian cycle maximizes learning and memory formation.
4. **Maximizing Focus:**  Create a distraction-free environment and utilize tools like stopwatches to track the duration of focused work.
5. **Early Morning Shift:**  Combining early morning exercise, sunlight, and caffeine can shift the morning cortisol peak, allowing for an additional ultradian cycle for focused work.
6. **Non-Sleep Deep Rest:** This state of restful alertness, achieved through techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises, plays a crucial role in consolidating learning.
7. **Ultradian Cycles and Physical Skills:** These cycles can also be used to optimize physical skill learning and enhance athletic performance.

## Introduction
This Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode delves into the science behind ultradian cycles and how they can be leveraged for optimal learning.  Andrew Huberman answers a viewer question about incorporating ultradian rhythms into daily work, explaining how these cycles influence focus, alertness, and neuroplasticity. The episode also touches on the importance of Non-Sleep Deep Rest for memory consolidation and offers advice on maximizing these cycles for both cognitive and physical skill learning.

### Ultradian Rhythms and Focused Learning [0:01:09]

- **Ultradian Rhythms:** These are cycles that occur shorter than 24 hours, with the most commonly discussed being the 90-minute cycles.
- **Leveraging for Learning:** Huberman explains that these cycles are particularly beneficial for focused mental work, including learning, writing, and creative tasks.
- **Identifying Peak Alertness:** The best time to start an ultradian work block is when you experience peak alertness after waking, which typically occurs 1-2 hours after rising.
- **Cortisol Fluctuations:**  Ultradian cycles are triggered by fluctuations in the glucocorticoid system, primarily the release of cortisol. The morning cortisol peak, enhanced by sunlight, sets in motion these cycles.
- **Neuroplasticity:** The molecules responsible for neuroplasticity, including BDNF, fluctuate with these ultradian cycles, making certain periods of the day ideal for triggering learning.

### Maximizing Ultradian Cycles for Learning [0:10:40]

- **Two Major Peaks:** Two primary peaks in the glucocorticoid system offer ideal opportunities for focused work, one in the early morning and another in the late afternoon.
- **60-Minute Focus:**  While an ultradian cycle is 90 minutes, the most effective period for learning is approximately 60 minutes.
- **Morning Work Block:**  Waking up earlier and incorporating exercise, sunlight, and caffeine can shift the morning cortisol peak, allowing for a third ultradian work block.
- **Non-Sleep Deep Rest:**  Huberman emphasizes that memory consolidation and rewiring of neurons occur during sleep and Non-Sleep Deep Rest, suggesting the importance of these states for learning.

### Ultradian Cycles and Physical Skills [0:20:55]

- **Motor Skill Learning:**  Ultradian cycles also impact physical skill learning, making them beneficial for improving athletic performance, dancing, or any activity requiring focused movement and cognitive attention.

## Practical Advice and Strategies
- **Identify Peak Alertness:** Monitor your alertness levels throughout the day to identify the times when you experience peak focus.
- **Schedule Focus Blocks:** Once identified, schedule 90-minute focus blocks around these peak times.
- **Distraction-Free Environment:**  Eliminate distractions during focus blocks by turning off Wi-Fi, putting your phone away, and creating a dedicated space.
- **Emphasize Deep Focus:**  Acknowledge that it may take 10-15 minutes to reach deep focus and that distractions are normal.  Refocus and continue working through the 60-minute window.
- **Early Morning Routine:**  Consider an early morning routine that includes exercise, sunlight, and caffeine to shift the morning cortisol peak and potentially capture an additional ultradian cycle.
- **Incorporate Non-Sleep Deep Rest:**  Schedule regular Non-Sleep Deep Rest sessions to maximize memory consolidation and accelerate learning.

## Tools and Resources Mentioned
- **Stopwatch:** Use a stopwatch to track the duration of your focused work blocks.
- **Light Therapy:**  Utilize bright artificial light or sunlight exposure to enhance the morning cortisol peak.
- **Iterative Metaplasticity:**  Research the term “iterative metaplasticity” to learn more about the underlying neurobiology of ultradian cycles and their impact on learning.
