# Elissa Epel: Control Stress for Healthy Eating, Metabolism, Aging

## Key Takeaways
1. Stress is a natural response to challenges, but chronic stress can be harmful.
2. Our thoughts are a major source of stress. 
3. There are three categories of tools to manage stress: top-down strategies (mindset), body-based interventions, and changing the environment.
4. Stress can be beneficial in small, manageable doses, promoting resilience and even enhancing brain health.
5. Mindfulness and breathwork can significantly impact stress response, mood, and cellular aging.
6. Compulsive eating is linked to stress, particularly for those with insulin resistance, and can be addressed through mindful eating practices and lifestyle changes.
7. Radical acceptance is a powerful tool for managing chronic stressors that cannot be easily changed.

## Introduction
This episode of the Huberman Lab podcast features a conversation with Dr. Elissa Epel, a professor of Psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and an expert on the effects of stress on our bodies and minds. Dr. Epel's research explores the link between stress, our cellular aging, and our behavioral choices, especially regarding food.

### Defining Stress & The Stress Response [0:06:18]
- Stress is a natural response to feeling overwhelmed, a mismatch between demands and resources.
- The key is not just the stressors themselves, but how we respond to them.
- Our thoughts are a common source of stress, leading to a chronic sympathetic nervous system dominance.
- The stress response uses a lot of energy, leading to exhaustion. 
- Recognizing where we hold stress in our bodies can be a first step to releasing it.

### Tools: Managing Overthinking & Ruminating [0:12:50]
- Three categories of tools for managing overthinking:
    - Top-down strategies: Increasing awareness and using positive self-talk.
    - Body-based interventions: Exercise, breathwork, sleep, deep rest. 
    - Changing the environment: Creating a "safe space" with calming cues like pictures, smells, and music.

### Acute, Moderate & Chronic Stress [0:15:37]
- **Acute Stress Response:** Short-term, high-energy mobilization to cope with immediate challenges.
- **Moderate Stressful Events:** Last for days or months, requiring attention to daily restoration.
- **Chronic Stressful Situations:**  Persist for years, demanding coping mechanisms and possibly radical acceptance.

### Stress Benefits, Aging & Cognition; Stress Challenge Response [0:21:23]
- Stress can have both positive and negative effects on aging and cognition.
- Optimal aging involves a moderate level of challenge, not no stress at all.
-  Engaging in challenging activities can promote hippocampal growth and improve cognitive function.
- Two types of psychological stress response:
    - **Threat Response:**  Survival-based, with exaggerated physiological reactions and slower recovery.
    - **Challenge Response:**  Activated, excited, with increased cardiac output and less inflammation.

### Tool: Shifting Stress to Challenge Response, “Stress Shields” [0:32:19]
- Mindset plays a crucial role in shaping our stress response.
- We can use "stress shields" - statements or scripts to promote the challenge response.
- Examples of stress shields:
    - Remind yourself of past successes.
    - Distancing from the stressor (e.g., "This won't matter in 10 years").
    - Reframe stress as empowering ("My body is doing what it should").
- Research shows that viewing stress as positive can improve performance and recovery.

### Stress, Overeating, Craving & Opioid System [0:37:40]
- Stress can trigger overeating and cravings, especially for high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt foods.
- This is partly due to the activation of the opioid system, which mediates feelings of reward and pleasure.
- People with obesity often have a higher reward response to food during stress.
-  The drug naltrexone can block opioid receptors and has been used to help people with binge eating.

### Tools: Breaking Overeating Cycles, Mindfulness [0:48:55]
- Breaking the stress-overeating cycle requires a multi-pronged approach:
    - **Mindful Eating:**  Checking in with hunger, slowing down, and increasing awareness of bodily sensations.
    - **Positive Stress Pathway:** Engaging in activities that promote stress resilience (e.g., HIIT exercise).
    - **Surf the Craving:**  Learning to ride the urge to consume without giving in.
    - **Creating Safe Environments:**  Removing tempting foods and drinks from home and workplace.

### Soda & Sugary Drinks [0:54:44]
- Sugary drinks, especially soda and energy drinks, are particularly harmful to health.
-  Liquid sugar is more addictive than solid sugar because it enters the bloodstream faster.
-  Sugary drinks can contribute to compulsive eating and weight gain.

### Smoking, Processed Food & Rebellion [1:00:51]
-  The battle against smoking was most effective when it tapped into a sense of rebellion among youth.
-  Similar strategies might be necessary to combat the consumption of highly processed foods and sugary drinks.
-  It's essential to expose people to the manipulative tactics of the food industry.

### Tools: Mindfulness, Pregnancy & Metabolic Health [1:06:47]
-  Mindfulness training during pregnancy can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce excessive weight gain in mothers.
-  Benefits extend to the offspring, who have lower obesity rates and healthier stress responses.
-  Mindfulness intervention involved:
    - Weekly group meetings.
    - Daily mindful check-ins with breathwork and movement (e.g., prenatal yoga).

### Body Scan & Cravings [1:14:11]
- Body scans can reduce cravings by shifting focus from external stimuli (exteroception) to internal bodily sensations (interoception).
- Craving might involve a strong link between exteroception and interoception, hijacking our prefrontal cortex.
-  Body scans and other mind-body practices can help break this link.

### Tool: Meditation & Aging; Meditation Retreats [1:17:28]
-  Long-term meditation practice is associated with slower biological aging and improved mental health.
-  Meditation retreats can have a significant impact on gene expression and stress resilience.
-  People with early adversity tend to benefit most from meditation.

### Meditation, Psychedelics & Neuroplasticity [1:23:35]
-  Meditation and psychedelics both promote neuroplasticity and can be complementary practices.
-  The most significant brain rewiring from psychedelics often happens in the integration period after the experience.
-  Training in metacognition (awareness of one's own thoughts and mental processes) can enhance psychedelic experiences.

### Mitochondrial Health, Stress & Mood [1:26:02]
-  Chronic stress can impair mitochondrial function, reducing energy production and contributing to exhaustion.
-  Caregivers, for example, often have lower mitochondrial activity and more negative mood.
-  Maintaining a positive mood, particularly at night, is critical for long-term health.
-  Daily mood appears to be correlated with mitochondrial levels.

### Chronic Stress & Radical Acceptance, “Brick Wall” [1:29:49]
-  Radical acceptance involves recognizing and accepting situations we cannot change.
-  It's a practice that helps us loosen our grip on unwanted stressors and reduces mental and physical strain.
-  Metaphor of pulling on a brick wall:  We can't change the wall, but we can free our hands from the rope.

### Tool: Control, Uncertainty [1:37:57]
-  Humans have a strong drive for control, which can lead to distress when faced with uncertainty.
-  Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with anxiety, depression, and poor coping with stressful events.
-  Developing a tolerance for uncertainty requires practice:
    -  Mindful check-ins to acknowledge uncertainty.
    -  Reframing uncertainty as a source of freedom and mystery.
    -  Adopting a receptive posture to embrace the unfolding of time.

### Stress Management, “Skillful Surfing” [1:45:25]
-  We need both proactive (muscle it) and receptive (release it) strategies for stress management.
-  Life is like an ocean with waves of stress: 
    -  Muscle it during the wave.
    -  Release it between waves.
    -  Skillful surfing involves knowing when to control and when to let go.

### Narrative, Purpose & Stress [1:50:25]
-  Creating a coherent narrative around stressful events is essential for finding meaning and resolution.
-  Journaling can be a valuable tool for this process.
-  A sense of purpose can help us rise above challenges and find meaning in difficult situations.

### Breathwork, Wim Hof Method, Positivity & Cellular Aging [1:52:49]
-  The Wim Hof Method, a breathwork practice, promotes stress resilience and positive emotions.
-  Dr. Epel's research explores the effects of the Wim Hof Method on mitochondrial health, cellular aging, and gene expression.
-  Preliminary findings suggest that the Wim Hof Method increases positive emotions over time, similar to sighing.
-  The study is examining the effects of various stress interventions on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
