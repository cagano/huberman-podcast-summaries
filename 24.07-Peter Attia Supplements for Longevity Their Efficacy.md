##  NAD Pathway: Supplements for Longevity, Their Efficacy

## Key Takeaways
1. **Longevity Approaches:**  There are four key categories of longevity approaches: essential behaviors (eating, sleeping, moving), exogenous molecules targeting specific diseases, exogenous molecules targeting aging hallmarks, and a comprehensive "do everything" category.
2. **Rapamycin:**  Rapamycin has demonstrated consistent lifespan extension across multiple species and is one of the few interventions with strong experimental support.
3. **NAD Pathway:**  NAD is crucial for energy production and DNA repair. While NAD levels decline with age, there is no clear evidence that increasing NAD levels through supplementation extends lifespan.
4. **Sirtuins:**  Sirtuins are enzymes that use NAD as a substrate for DNA repair. While sirtuin overexpression may extend lifespan in some yeast strains and a transgenic mouse model, evidence in mammals is limited. 
5. **Resveratrol:**  Resveratrol, a purported sirtuin activator, has shown inconsistent effects on lifespan and no significant impact in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP).
6. **NR & NMN:**  NR and NMN are NAD precursors with limited evidence for lifespan benefits. While they may increase NAD levels, their impact on cellular NAD levels and overall health is unclear. 
7. **Exercise Timing:**  Exercising early in the morning may increase energy levels throughout the day, suggesting a potential benefit to timing exercise strategically.
