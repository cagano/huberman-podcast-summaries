## Episode 3: Office Hours - Sleep, Learning, and Metabolism

## Key Takeaways

1. **Moonlight, candlelight, and even fireplace light do not reset your circadian clock at night.** This is because your eye's melanopsin ganglion cells adjust their sensitivity to light across the day and are less responsive to these dimmer light sources.
2. **Red light, especially dim red light, will not significantly impact your circadian rhythm at night.** However, bright red light devices commonly marketed for health benefits can be too bright and disrupt sleep.
3. **Blue light blockers are not a scientifically sound approach to circadian rhythm management.** While blue light is the strongest stimulus for melanopsin ganglion cells, those cells respond to other wavelengths of light as well and are influenced by signals from photoreceptors. 
4. **Exercise, like light, can entrain your circadian rhythm.**  The best times to exercise for optimized performance and reduced injury are 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking. 
5. **Temperature is the effector of circadian rhythm, not just a consequence of it.**  Shifts in temperature, whether through exercise, cold exposure, or eating, can significantly impact your circadian rhythm and sleep.

### Moonlight & Fire (0:05:50)
- One lux of light intensity is equivalent to the illumination of one square meter surface at one meter away from a single candle. 
- Moonlight, candlelight, and fireplace light are not strong enough to reset the circadian clock at night. 
- This is due to the sensitivity of melanopsin ganglion cells, which are most responsive to the blue-yellow contrast of the rising and setting sun. 

### Red Light: Good & Bad (0:09:25)
- Red light devices marketed for health benefits often use very bright lights that can disrupt sleep.
- One study suggests that red light exposure in the morning may improve mitochondrial function in photoreceptor cells, potentially delaying vision loss.
- For avoiding the negative effects of light at night, red light should be very dim.

### Why Blue-Blockers Are Unscientific (0:15:45)
- Melanopsin ganglion cells are not solely sensitive to blue light. 
- They are also influenced by signals from photoreceptors, making blue light blockers less effective than often claimed. 

### Eyeglasses, Contact Lenses & Windows (0:19:20)
- Prescription lenses and contacts do not significantly affect your circadian rhythm because they focus light onto the retina. 
- Windows scatter and filter light, reducing the effectiveness of sunlight for resetting your circadian clock.

### Adding Up Your Lights (0:22:05)
- You can sum or add photon activation of melanopsin ganglion cells during the early hours of the day. 
- Get outside in the morning, even if it's overcast, and use bright, overhead lights indoors. 
- Later in the day, these cells are more sensitive to light, making it crucial to avoid bright lights at night. 

### "Netflix Inoculation" With Light (0:24:30)
- Viewing the setting sun, even if it's not crossing the horizon, can help to adjust your retinal sensitivity and melatonin pathway, making you less susceptible to the negative effects of light at night.

### How The Planet Controls Your Energy (0:25:25)
- Every cell in your body is sensitive to day length, which is determined by the duration of the melatonin signal. 
- Longer days and nights mean less melatonin and more energetic states; shorter days and nights mean more melatonin and more lethargic states.
- Humans are not purely seasonal breeders, but there are still some shifts in breeding and fertility that correspond to seasons.

### Melatonin / Serotonin (0:31:15)
- Melatonin is synthesized from serotonin. 
- Serotonin promotes feelings of well-being and quiescence, while dopamine promotes reward and action. 
- Bright light in the middle of the night reduces dopamine levels, potentially impacting learning, memory, and mood. 

### Epinephrine vs Adrenaline: Same? Different?: (0:33:50)
- Epinephrine and adrenaline are the same molecule, but epinephrine is released within the brain, while adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands.

### Exercise & Your Sleep (0:35:00)
- Optimal times for exercise, according to some studies, are 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking, corresponding to natural shifts in body temperature.
- Exercising first thing in the morning can create an anticipatory circuit that makes it easier to wake up at that time. 
- Intense exercise late in the day can disrupt sleep, while lower-intensity exercise may have less of an impact.

### Neuroplasticity & Food/Chemicals/NSDR (0:40:30)
- Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience, extends to circadian rhythms and sleep. 
- Our bodies develop anticipatory circuits for activities like eating and exercise. 
- Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) and short naps can enhance neuroplasticity and learning.

### Using Sound & Smell To Learn Faster (0:44:10)
- Studies show that delivering the same auditory or olfactory stimulus during learning and sleep can enhance learning and retention. 

### Dream Meaning & Remembering (0:46:45)
- Dream meaning is a controversial topic. Some believe dreams have symbolic meaning, while others believe they are simply random neural firing.
- To remember dreams better, try setting an alarm to wake you up during REM sleep, or write down your thoughts immediately upon waking.

### Waking Up Paralyzed (0:48:15)
- Sleep paralysis, a state of waking up paralyzed, can occur due to the carryover of atonia (muscle paralysis) from sleep. 
- Marijuana use has been linked to an increased frequency of sleep paralysis. 

### Nap/Focus Ratios For Accelerated Learning (0:49:40)
- A 20-minute bout of NSDR immediately after a 90-minute period of focused learning can significantly accelerate learning and retention.

### Hypnotizing Yourself (0:52:45)
- Hypnosis combines focus and deep rest, potentially enhancing neuroplasticity. 
- It is primarily used to shift states of mind, like fear to calm, rather than for learning specific information.

### Smart Drugs (0:54:05)
- "Smart drugs" or nootropics are not specific enough to target particular cognitive algorithms. 
- Nootropics typically include stimulants like caffeine and acetylcholine boosters.
- They can be helpful for short-term focus but often cause a crash that disrupts sleep and learning.

### Magnesium: Yay, Nay, or Meh?: (1:01:10)
- Magnesium threonate, a form of magnesium, is often recommended for sleep, but individual responses vary. 
- It should be taken 30-60 minutes before sleep and may cause gastrointestinal issues in some people.

### How Apigenin Works (1:02:10)
- Apigenin, a compound found in chamomile, increases GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) activity, which promotes relaxation and sleep. 

### Serotonin: Slippery Slope (1:04:30)
- While increasing serotonin might seem like a good strategy for sleep, individual responses can be unpredictable. 
- The author experienced a negative response to tryptophan and 5-HTP, experiencing a sleep rebound effect.

### The Frog Experiment (1:05:35)
- A joke about a scientist who incorrectly concludes that frog legs are used for hearing illustrates the importance of conducting multiple types of experiments and controlling for confounding variables.

### Temperature (1:08:35)
- Body temperature naturally cycles over a 24-hour period, reaching its lowest point around 4:00 AM and peaking between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.
- Temperature is entrained by external cues, primarily light but also exercise.

### Morning Chills (1:10:30)
- Feeling chilled or cold in the morning can indicate that your internal circadian clock is drifting out of sync with your external environment.
- Ensure you get enough sunlight exposure in the morning to maintain temperature rhythm. 

### Temperature: The Effector (1:10:30)
- The superchiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock, influences temperature, which in turn, affects all the cells and tissues of your body.
- Shifting temperature through exercise, cold exposure, or even eating can alter circadian rhythms and sleep times.

### Eating For Heating (1:28:00)
- Eating triggers eating-induced thermogenesis, a slight increase in body temperature. 
- This effect is likely greatest with amino acid-rich foods, but all foods contribute to some degree.
- Food volume also impacts sleep.  Large volumes of food can trigger a calming response and induce sleepiness.

### Vagal Pathways For Gut-Brain Dialogue (1:30:30)
- The vagus nerve, a cranial nerve that connects the brain to the gut, transmits sensory information about food volume to the brain. 

### Sex Differences (1:31:50)
- Sex differences in neurotransmitter profiles, sleep rhythms, and temperature regulation are complex and warrant further study. 

### Self Experimentation (1:33:50)
- To become more aware of how your body responds to various factors, experiment with your sleep, light exposure, exercise, and eating patterns. 
- Start by changing one or two variables at a time to identify the most significant factors for you.

## Practical Advice and Strategies

### Light
- Maximize sunlight exposure in the morning, even if it's cloudy.
- Use bright, overhead lights indoors.
- Avoid bright lights at night. 
- View the setting sun, even if it's not directly crossing the horizon, to adjust your retinal sensitivity and melatonin pathway.

### Exercise 
- Consider exercising 30 minutes, 3 hours, or 11 hours after waking.
- Experiment with morning exercise to create an anticipatory circuit that makes it easier to wake up early.
- If you find that intense exercise late in the day disrupts your sleep, reduce intensity or choose a different time for your workout.

### Food
- Experiment with carbohydrate-rich meals in the evening to increase tryptophan levels and promote relaxation.
- Consider a low-carb diet during the day to increase alertness and dopamine production.
- Eat meals in alignment with your desired wake-up time. 

### Temperature
- Use cold exposure early in the day for a rapid rise in body temperature and potential phase advance of your circadian rhythm.
- Shiver during cold exposure if you want to increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism.
- Avoid cold exposure late at night, as it can delay your circadian rhythm.

### Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) 
- Incorporate 20 minutes of NSDR, through meditation, yoga nidra, or hypnosis, for every 90 minutes of focused learning.
