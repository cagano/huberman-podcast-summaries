### What is Self-Care? (0:05:34)
- **Baseline self-care:** This includes eating well, staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, and moving the body. 
- **Self-understanding:**  It's crucial to understand ourselves, including our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
- **Engaging with the world:**  We should assess how we engage with the world and relationships in a way that is generative and fulfilling. 
- **Preventive medicine:** Taking care of our mental health today prepares us for predictable challenges in the future. 

### Life Narratives (0:13:18)
- **Asking questions:** Constructing a life narrative can guide us to the right questions to ask ourselves.
- **Self-reflection:**  Journaling or reflecting on key events can expose truths about ourselves and provide a sense of grounding in time.
- **Sharing with a trusted other:** Discussing our narratives with a trusted person can provide valuable insights and support.

### Journaling & Self-Inquiry (0:15:24)
- **Unconscious mind access:**  Journaling or talking about our lives can help us access the unconscious mind, revealing hidden truths and patterns. 
- **Knowledge is power:**  Sharing information about mental health, trauma, and self-care can empower individuals to understand and manage their own well-being. 

### Unconscious Mind & Salience (0:24:41)
- **Salience shift:**  When we relax and stop focusing outward, the unconscious mind can bring things to the surface, leading to insights or panic attacks.
- **Liminal states:**  Times of day when the brain is in a liminal state (between sleep and awake) can be conducive to insights from the unconscious. 

### Self-Inquiry & Grief (0:28:20)
- **Subconscious revelations:**  Engaging in self-inquiry can lead to subconscious revelations and insights that can improve our understanding of ourselves. 
- **Processing trauma:**  It is important to acknowledge and process difficult experiences, even those from the past, to prevent them from becoming "abscesses" in the unconscious mind. 

### Self-Harm & Therapy (0:34:39)
- **Self-inquiry limitations:**  Self-inquiry is not always the right answer, especially when experiencing self-harm, hopelessness, or significant distress. Seeking professional help is crucial in these situations. 
- **Therapy as a guide:**  A therapist can guide us through self-inquiry and help us understand and address our unconscious patterns.

### Apprehension of Unconscious Mind Exploration (0:37:27)
- **Balancing self-awareness and salience:**  It's important to address the fear that exploring the unconscious mind might lead to negative thoughts becoming overly salient.
- **Dealing with challenging thoughts:**  Just as we address physical injuries, we must deal with challenging thoughts and traumas to achieve optimal well-being.

### Mental Health Map: Cupboards, Agency & Gratitude, Generative Drive (0:42:34)
- **The "Mental Health Map" framework:**  This map consists of two pillars (Structure of Self and Function of Self) with ten cupboards representing areas of inquiry. 
- **Generative drive:** This drive is essential for growth, learning, creation, and prosocial behaviors.
- **Agency and gratitude:**  These verb states are the ultimate expression of a healthy structure and function of self. 
- **Empowerment and humility:**  These qualities are potential states that are activated when we tend to the pillars and cupboards of the map.

### Structure of Self, Unconscious Mind, Abscess Analogy (0:54:18)
- **Unconscious mind as a supercomputer:**  The unconscious mind is a complex biological system that has a significant impact on our conscious mind. 
- **Abscess analogy:**  The unconscious mind can contain "abscesses" - walled-off traumas or negative experiences that can harm our well-being. 
- **Therapy as surgery:**  Therapy can help us identify and address these "abscesses," just as surgery removes physical abscesses.

### Exploring the Unconscious Mind (1:01:57)
- **Developing self-curiosity:** Embracing curiosity about ourselves, including past events and memories, can lead to greater self-understanding. 
- **"Observing ego":**  Developing an "observing ego" allows us to step outside of ourselves and view our experiences with less emotional attachment.
- **Questioning the "givens":**  Challenging our negative self-narratives and questioning the "givens" of our experiences can reveal truths about ourselves.

### Conscious Mind Exploration (1:10:48)
- **Exploring conscious choices:**  Examining our daily actions and behaviors can provide insights into our conscious mind and unconscious patterns.
- **Cognitive behavioral tactics:**  Thought redirection techniques can help us manage negative thoughts and improve our well-being. 

### Behavior & Self-Reflection (1:52:37)
- **Behavior patterns:**  Observing our behavior patterns and reflecting on their impact can lead to greater awareness and control.
- **Automatic behaviors:**  We often perform actions automatically without conscious awareness, making self-reflection crucial for recognizing patterns.

### Defense Mechanisms in Action (1:38:34)
- **Defense mechanisms in action:**  Defense mechanisms are unconscious processes that can be understood by reflecting on our behaviors and patterns.
- **Identifying patterns:** Recognizing unhealthy patterns can help us identify maladaptive defense mechanisms.

### Salience Exploration (1:47:15)
- **Grounding meditation:**  Grounding meditations can help shift our salience from internal thoughts to external awareness, improving our ability to manage stress and anxiety. 

### Function of Self Cupboards (1:32:45)
- **Function of Self cupboards:**  These include self-awareness, defense mechanisms in action, salience, behavior, and strivings.
- **Self-awareness:**  Understanding the "I" and how we navigate the world is a critical aspect of self-care.

### Self-Awareness Exploration (1:35:50)
- **Mirror meditation:**  This practice involves looking in the mirror and focusing on our physical body, presence, and agency. 
- **Exploring self-narratives:**  Examining the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves can help us develop greater self-awareness.

### Character Structure (1:24:54)
- **Character structure as a nest:** This nest encompasses our unconscious mind, conscious mind, defense mechanisms, and serves as a foundation for the self.
- **Tending the garden of self:**  We are responsible for tending the garden of self, cultivating healthy growth and removing negative influences. 

### Friendships & Support (2:17:49)
- **Surrounding ourselves with good people:**  It's crucial to surround ourselves with supportive and positive individuals who can contribute to our well-being.
- **Online communities:**  Social media and online communities can provide valuable support and connection, especially for individuals who feel isolated.

### Anger & Self-Care (2:23:50)
- **Anger as an affect:**  Anger is an affect, an arousal that we can't immediately control, but can manage through self-care. 
- **Managing anger:**  Taking care of ourselves reduces the arousal of anger, allowing us to manage it more effectively. 
- **Anger's impact on the generative drive:**  High levels of anger are detrimental to the generative drive, making it crucial to control anger and maintain a low to moderate level. 

### Challenges in Certain Life Domains (2:09:07)
- **Don't make yourself special in ways that hurt you:**  It's common to feel that certain areas of life are inaccessible, but this often stems from negative self-narratives. 
- **The power of self-belief:**  We have the potential to achieve anything we set our minds to, even in areas where we have experienced challenges.
